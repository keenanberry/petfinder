# petfinder
A web scraping project for my Unix Tools course. This tool will scrape petfinder.com for dogs in and around Austin, TX. The goal of the project is to generate a dataset of attributes associated with adoptable dogs. Long-term plans are to potentially add the data to Kaggle for others to use ML and NLP to predict/determine the strongest adoption features.
