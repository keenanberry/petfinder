My family vowed to take me with them if they ever moved because I was part of the family, protected the kids from harm and played with them, but when it came time for them to move, they didn&#039;t keep their word and left me behind!! I have been in two different fosters homes now and it isn&#039;t the same. I am really sad and lonely and missing my family so much. I had two small children for my friends and I loved them a lot. I wonder if they will remember me when they grow up, and wonder what happened to me? I will never forget about them but it would help me to heal if I could find another family to love. The foster family I have been with for the last 6 months are doing their best, but I really need a home of my own.  I am very strong, but very sweet. I prefer to be the only pet in the home because I want all of the attention. I really miss sleeping with the kids at night and playing with them during the day. I am a high energy dog that will need daily exercise such as walks. I would be a great companion for a walker or a jogger. I would also be a good candidate for someone interested in agility training because I am very intelligent.

I&#039;m nine years old (born Aug. 21, 2009) and weigh about 85 pounds. I&#039;ve been microchipped and have received my rabies and distemper\/parvo\/parainfluenza shots. I&#039;ve been neutered. I have diabetes and require two insulin injections each day -- the cost per month for this treatment is about $300. I have been treated with monthly flea and tick drops and am on monthly heartworm preventive. My mom was dumped at the Smithville Animal Shelter and was taken home by Blue Sky Animal Rescue just one day before I and my six brothers and sisters were born. I&#039;m happy and am housebroken. I need to be an only dog because I tend to try to protect my family against any other animals. I&#039;d be a good fit with an individual or family who loves to jog or walk. I have too much energy for very small children but would love to play with older kids. I love to cuddle and have a funny fondness for eating ice cubes -- I run to the refrigerator when i hear the ice machine being used. Each animal at Blue Sky Animal Rescue is spayed or neutered, fully vaccinated, heartworm tested, heartworm treated if applicable, de-wormed, given monthly heartworm prevention medication and monthly flea\/tick prevention, and dental care as needed. In many cases, the cost of vetting services is greater than the adoption contribution. The adoption contributions (cash only) help defray the costs of vetting services, but rarely, if ever, cover all expenses. Additional donations are welcomed and much appreciated. Hayden&#039;s adoption contribution is $80, and additional donations are welcomed.

24402008	721.4344072142117	"Black Labrador Retriever"	"null"	false	"Black"	"Young"	"Male"	"Large"	"Short"	"Tito"	"&lt;p&gt;Tito is an exuberant, active, friendly young lab who has had a hard time catching a break in life.&lt;br \/&gt;&lt;br \/&gt;This boy was brought to the shelter in July with a broken front leg, after a Good Samaritan found him. Tito was lucky enough to find a foster home so he could heal -- but came back to the shelter after eating some de-greaser. Lab pups in general need a lot of exercise and they need to be kept away from things they can damage when their person is gone, because they tend to get into things and chew. Tito did that.&lt;br \/&gt;&lt;br \/&gt;He is also a smart boy who adores training -- he loves earning treats and toys. He likes puzzle toys, too. He is friendly and can be super-affectionate, but he also can be rambunctious and jump up on people, so he needs someone who is used to handling big dogs and can help this boy grow into the model canine citizen he was meant to be. &lt;br \/&gt;&lt;br \/&gt;Tito needs a home that will give him the mental and physical activity and loving structure that he craves. To help with that, Tito&#039;s adopter will get a $250 voucher toward training to make sure he gets a good start in his new life. &lt;br \/&gt;&lt;br \/&gt;His time is running out quickly to find a forever home. Please visit Tito at Austin Animal Center in East Austin on Levander Loop if you think you may have room in your home and heart for him. His animal ID # is 632753, and he is in Kennel 209. Feel free to email or to call volunteer Peggy with any questions, 512 496-7090.&lt;br \/&gt;&lt;br \/&gt;Tito is a bit over a year old now, and he is neutered. &lt;br \/&gt;&lt;br \/&gt;Information on this animal is posted as a courtesy.

I&#039;m a great climber too and would love to take hikes in the Hill Country. I&#039;m sure I would love taking trips down to the river and beach since I love water.

Her story with me began last year when I stopped at a gas station in a bad part of town. She was laying lifeless on the pavement. Truthfully I thought she was dead, but as I got closer her little tail began to flick. She was emaciated, bald, extremely heart-worm positive, shot and hit by a car. She suffered all of that at the hands of humans and she was licking my face as I lifted her into my car. Dogs are amazing creatures!&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;After a long recovery, she did not end up needing an amputation on her gun shot leg. Thank goodness! She is now about 2-4 years old, 53 lbs, spayed, utd on shots, well into her slow kill heart-worm treatment, and happy running all day. I have been keeping her at a boarding facility since August and will not be able to keep her there much longer. I have done dog rescue for several years now as an independent, and pay out of pocket. It&#039;s my charity, and the joy in my life! I love bullies!&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Ellie Mae is a wonderful dog with people, any and all. Animals are a different story. She is very animal aggressive and it is not fear based. It is more predatory. I have tried to correct her and train her every way I know how. Since I am unable to keep her at my home safely, I am having to board her, which I can no do much longer.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Won&#039;t you PLEASE give Ellie Mae a chance to show you what a wonderful companion she can be?

Emmie is house-trained, crate-trained and knows 20 commands, including sit, down, look away, wait, drop it and even doggie pushups. She has her foundation training under her belt. \n\nEmmie goes on field trips every weeks. She enjoys downtown, Mueller Park and Lady Bird Lake trail. She loves the vibe of South Congress and gets excited when we drive up (her dearest wish is to be the shop dog for Hudson&#039;s smoked meats). She rides nicely in the car. \n\nEmmie was saved from the shelter minutes before she was due to be euthanized -- we couldn&#039;t stand the idea of this bright light not getting a chance to shine. \n\nShe is an affectionate girl who pays close attention to her person. She loves petting and will sit close, leaning into you. She looks back over her shoulder at you on walks to be sure she&#039;s doing what you want her to do. \n\nShe would be a perfect running or walking buddy. She has shown an interest in agility training -- a real self-starter, she started using the equipment at the shelter as soon as she saw it. The whole crew loves her at her trainer&#039;s place. \n\nShe is still learning to be calm around other dogs so she&#039;s not recommended to go to a home with another dog at this point. And she wants to chase cats, so a cat-free household would be best for her. \n\nShe is not reactive to all other dogs -- on the trail and at the farmers&#039; market, she will walk calmly by some dogs but bark at others. We think she wants to play. But we are teaching her that she needs to be calm around other pets until it&#039;s playtime. \n\nEmmie has heartworms, but the treatment cost will be covered. She has already started on the medication that she must take before treatment. After treatment and a period of rest, she will be cured and healthy. \n\nEmmie could be the best gift you ever give yourself!  :-)\n\nInformation on this animal is posted as a courtesy.

While Ireland is very outgoing, India is a bit on the shy side and takes awhile to warm up. She is playful with other dogs and especially enjoys being with her sister.  Masticatory muscle myositis. Huh? That&#039;s what we said too! Our first indication that something was wrong with India was when her eye started to droop and the inner eyelid was protruding. We immediately thought she had been stung by something and rushed her to the vet. The diagnosis was much worse than an insect sting. Little issues she had been having over the past weeks began to make sense. She was refusing to eat her kibble and preferred softer food. We thought it might be a dental issue, but her teeth looked good.  We soon learned that one of the main symptoms of MMM is difficulty opening the jaw and chewing without pain. This is why she was having trouble eating. Further testing confirmed that India was indeed suffering from MMM, an auto immune disease, which usually affects larger breed dogs. The only treatment is long-term prednisone. She successfully came through the first flare up and began eating normally again. She&#039;s had a couple of subsequent flare ups since she was first diagnosed that seem to resolve with prednisone. During these flares she shows the classic concave skull associated with MMM, which is indicative of the masticatory muscles contracting. While India&#039;s condition does not seem to be life threatening, it is a known disorder that any adopters will have to watch for and make sure she receives prompt vet care whenever it presents itself. She&#039;s a little shy around people, but really loves playing with other dogs. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting India please visit our website at www.omcr.org and click on &quot;How to Adopt&quot; to download an application."

My name is Bleu. I am a medium-energy, cute, adorable, cuddly, and very sweet runt of the litter with eyes that really sparkle and that is waiting feverishly for you!! I was born on November 12, 2013. My siblings have all been adopted and I am the lone ranger. But I am the cutest of them all, my foster mama says, and when I am excited, my whole body wiggles. I guess I get that from Mom who can also be seen and adopted right here! Her name is Bella and she is very smart and playful just like me!. Right now, I live at a foster home. It is nice and my foster mom is so cool. She is the nicest foster mom ever, and I will hate to say goodbye, but what my little heart longs for is to wake up one morning to find out that YOU\u2019RE HERE!!!! You finally found me and you hug and cuddle me all the way to my very own home. Wow, my very own family who will love me forever and ever! Now, that is a doggy&#039;s hugest dream in the whole, wide world!! I know you will love and protect me just as I will love and protect you. I will be your bestest friend!! When you do arrive, you will find out that I love to play, jump and run, run, run around in a yard. I love lots of snuggles and hugs and I love to give kisses in return. If you have a little girl or boy that I could grow up with, we would be the best of pals and it would be so cool to have someone who would have as much energy as I do and would want to run and play with me. Maybe he\/she could teach me some tricks (you know, I am at that perfect age for training). That would be so much fun!! If you have other pets, I am cool with that, too!  Another of my faves at my foster home is playing with my foster brothers and sisters. I sure will miss them. Well, I will go for now, but don\u2019t take too long okay? It is really, really hard to wait for things. I am just so excited that I can hardly wait. My very own family! Love you soon!

Below is what his foster family has to say about Duke: \nDuke is a large mixed breed dog weighing about 65 pounds. No heartworm, fully vetted, loves kids\/dogs. \nDuke is a sweetheart of a dog and has a calm submissive personality; and this makes him a delightful companion for a family of any age or size. While he enjoys walks and frisking in the yard, he is very polite indoors and is excellent company when I am working at home or watching tv. He settles down very quickly when guests arrive. He rarely barks. I do not think he will do well with a cat; he has treed our &quot;visiting neighbor cats&quot; several times. Duke sleeps well at night; not waking until I get up (which is NOT early). Duke is completely housetrained and does not beg for food or grab food that is on the counters. He does not get on the furniture or the beds. Duke allows me to clean his feet by rolling on his back as soon as I grab a towel. I find him to be very intelligent; learning quickly and responding well to correction and positive reinforcement. He does not have any food or bowl aggression issues. \nI have thoroughly enjoyed this dog and know that the right home is out there. He needs activity and a loving owner. \nHe needs training in walking and staying in the crate when home alone. (He is an escape artist I have learned today - got out twice by squeezing through the top of the crate. On a personal note I have found him to be the best behaved new pet we have ever had. \n\nHere is a wonderful video of Duke in all his glory!  http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=l6Tbx_rpEZ4&amp;fmt=37\n\nInformation on this animal is posted as a courtesy.

I am a medium-energy, cute, adorable, cuddly, and very sweet runt of the litter with eyes that really sparkle and that is waiting feverishly for you!! I was born on November 12, 2013. My siblings have all been adopted and I am the lone ranger. But I am the cutest of them all, my foster mama says, and when I am excited, my whole body wiggles. I guess I get that from Mom who can also be seen and adopted right here! Her name is Bella and she is very smart and playful just like me!. Right now, I live at a foster home. It is nice and my foster mom is so cool. She is the nicest foster mom ever, and I will hate to say goodbye, but what my little heart longs for is to wake up one morning to find out that YOU\u2019RE HERE!!!! You finally found me and you hug and cuddle me all the way to my very own home. Wow, my very own family who will love me forever and ever! Now, that is a puppy&#039;s hugest dream in the whole, wide world!! I know you will love and protect me just as I will love and protect you. I will be your bestest friend!! When you do arrive, you will find out that I love to play, jump and run, run, run around in a yard. I love lots of snuggles and hugs and I love to give doggie kisses in return. If you have a little girl or boy that I could grow up with, we would be the best of pals and it would be so cool to have someone who would have as much energy as I do and would want to run and play with me. Maybe he\/she could teach me some tricks (you know, I am at that perfect age for training). That would be so much fun!! If you have other pets, I am cool with that, too!\u00a0 Another of my faves at my foster home is playing with my foster brothers and sisters. I sure will miss them. Well, I will go for now, but don\u2019t take too long okay? I am a young and it is really, really hard to wait for things. I am just so excited that I can hardly wait. My very own family! Love you soon! \n\nInformation on this animal is posted as a courtesy.

We were asked to rescue this poor girl and over time she has fully recovered from her injuries. She is coming along very nicely and bonding with her foster mom.  However, with anyone new, she still runs from them until she has time to get to know them. She gets very excited when she sees the volunteer who comes out weekly to walk the dogs and has warmed up to some volunteers after only two visits. That is a lot of progress for this sweet girl.\n\nShe loves to play with all the dogs and has a great little personality. She is sneaky at times and will wait by the other dog&#039;s crates and go in to steal their treats if she feels they don&#039;t eat them in time. She has never had a problem with any of the friendly dogs she meets. She is not pushy or hyper so she would make a great quiet house companion.\n\nName: Angel\nAge: 1-2 yrs. old\nGender: Female\nMix\/Purebred: Small shepherd mix\nWeight: 40-50 lbs.\nHousetrained: 99%\nCrate trained: crate trained but enjoys being out and can be trusted\nHeartworm Negative\/Positive: Negative\nSpayed\/Neutered: Spayed\nMicro chipped: Yes\nGood with other dogs: Yes, playful\nGood with cats: Doesn&#039;t seem to mind foster cat\nGood with children: Timid with all people\n\nWe feel like she would be ideal for a small family or single person who works from home with whom she can bond with without having to share affection or worry about new people coming and going.  She needs a very calm home. She might even work best in an apartment setting where the home was not too big and she could be closer to her person without feeling overwhelmed by large spaces. She would enjoy having a furry friend who could show her what trust and relaxation looks like. She needs someone who can understand her limits and is extremely patient. They also need to understand that fearful dogs work on their timeline and not any one person&#039;s.  She is totally capable of bonding with a new owner ( like she has with her foster mom), taking walks together, and she enjoys being petted after she learns to trust you. She wants to be a lap dog but she doesn&#039;t realize how much she has grown. She is a medium size dog who weighs about 45-50 lbs.\n\nAngel had a really rough start in life. She has not had any applications on her since she came to rescue so if you feel like you might be right for her needs please apply and come out and meet her.\ncome out and say HI!"

A couple of them do have a touch of demodex and are being treated.\n\n\nClick here to complete the adoption questionnaire (link at the top of the page) and email it to: kim@dogsrus.orgVisit our Website for more information about our shelter, adoption policies, and procedures.\n\u00a0"	"https:\/\/dl5zpyw5k3jeb.cloudfront.net\/photos\/pets\/29682417\/1\/?bust=1495847928"	"https:\/\/dl5zpyw5k3jeb.cloudfront.net\/photos\/pets\/29682417\/1\/?bust=1495847928"	"adoptable"	"Spay\/Neuter","Shots Current"	null	null	null	null	null	null	false	Las Lomas K9 Rescue &amp; Adoption Foundation	not-adopted

(as of February 14, 2018)\n\nThat is how many days Ari has been looking for a forever home. To be perfectly honest some of us at GAO had no idea what Ari&#039;s full story was. We learned a little bit more about her recently. \nAri was adopted as a puppy around 8 weeks old. She was surrendered to Williamson County Regional Animal Shelter in August of 2014 when she was about a year and a half old because her people were moving. How sad for Ari to be left at a shelter as a one and a half year old dog who (at that point in time) had spent her entire life in their home? She was then pulled into rescue by GAO to find her forever home. \n\nAri has touched the hearts of many people within the rescue community and, though GAO loves her dearly, we believe she deserves more than what she has currently. The owners and staff of Happy Trails Kennels are the most amazing and wonderful people who treat our dogs who reside there like royalty, but that is not a place for a dog to spend their entire life. Ari is deserving of a home, a family, and love. \nAri is an amazing girl with tremendous potential, but she also lacks confidence with other dogs which makes her seem unfriendly during meet &amp; greets. But with patience and the proper introduction, she quickly becomes curious and even submissive to more confident dogs. She lived with two other dogs in a previous foster home. Ari just needs time and patience to integrate her into a new home, but she&#039;ll definitely be worth it. There are several of us who know and love Ari as our own who would be more than happy to help make this transition easier if it meant she would officially be &quot;HOME&quot;. \nAri is one of the smartest dogs that has ever been in the care of our rescue and is highly treat motivated! Her previous fosters were AMAZING and taught her to have great manners! She knows a long list of commands like sit, stay, kennel up, settle, and more. She would make a wonderful running partner for anyone looking for a friend on the trails! She is house trained, kennel trained, up to date on vaccines, and spayed. She does very well with older children and loves all people she meets! She is big and strong and loves to play, so we would mainly recommend her for children over 12 yrs old. She can be energetic but also knows how to be a great big cuddle bug.\n\nPlease help us share this amazing girl and let\u2019s help her find her forever home. If you&#039;re interested in her or have any additional questions, please feel free to shoot us a message!

I pulled him from a high kill shelter in San Antonio, Texas. He was very emaciated and had a rear leg with a bone sticking out and broken in several places. Someone had abused him. But Scooter was still happy and loved to be held and his spirits had not been broken. He has been a trooper from day one, never making a sound even though he was in a lot of pain.\n\n His leg was so bad; the vet considered amputation but decided to watch the bones heal. And heal they did until he grew. The bone in one leg doesn&#039;t bend but that doesn&#039;t stop Scooter he jumps on the deck, runs upstairs to his room, plays chase with this foster brothers &amp; sisters and gets around normally just like the other dogs.\n\n His complete medical records and x-rays will come with him at the time of adoption.\n\n Someone else named him early on but his name Scooter so deserves, he is a SCOOTER. He only barks when he is talking to you. He bounces around still like a puppy and just a very happy guy. He gets along with everyone.\n\n He runs and plays with his foster brothers and sisters and he is just a sweet dog. Scooter is 1 1\/2 years old now; I got him when he was 2 months old. He weighs 47 pounds and has reached his adult height &amp; weight. \n\n He has a beautiful black wavy coat and he does not shed. His best friend is Bradley, a bigger white border collie who only has 3 legs. Bradley was hit by a car but when he came to my house and Scooter was so small, Bradley treated Scooter as if he were his child.

His mother belonged to a family who could no longer care for them so I fed them and took care of them but they stayed with the family. Then the family tired of them and didn&#039;t want them around anymore.\n\n I got his mother spayed, his sister spayed and adopted into a wonderful home. When we reached the clinic for his surgery Logan just lost it. He was so afraid; the clinic asks me to bring him back at a later time. Well that trip spooked Logan and he would not let me touch him ever again. He ran to me when I showed up to feed him, he knew the sound of my car and he knew his name.\n\n Since he was not neutered, he traveled the streets to get with any female in heat. I&#039;m sure Logan has several kids out there :) One night Logan was experiencing some pleasure with one of his girlfriends (Ruby, also for adoption) when he was attacked by 2 vicious stray pit bulls who wanted Ruby for themselves.\n\n Logan had his testicles pulled right out by those pit bulls. So now Logan had no problem with me touching him and putting him in the car, he needed my help. His surgery went well, just a normal neutering as it turned out. He had some bite wounds on his legs but they healed well.\n\n Unfortunately Logan has heartworms and will need to have the 2 day treatment at the vet&#039;s office to get rid of them. After than Logan will be heartworm free and available for adoption.\n\n We are trying to raise funds for his surgery $400. Please consider donating towards his Heartworm treatment, no amount is too small we would very much appreciate it. You can donate on our website or directly to Callaghan Road Animal Hospital to Roxy&#039;s K-9 Rescue\/Logan&#039;s Heartworm Treatment. (210) 647-1101\n\n And of course if you would like to adopt Logan once his treatment is complete, please email me. Logan would love to have a home of his own so he can be spoiled even more.\n\n Logan came into my home as if he had always lived here, he loves some love. He is quiet, plays very well with my personal dogs and he LOVES his bed. I just laugh at him and tell him, he could have been living inside the life of luxury 2 years ago if he hadn&#039;t decided against being fixed!!!!\n\n I loved his entire family from the time I met them. His mother was extremely sweet and calm and he is just like her.\n\n  \n\n Please consider sharing Logan&#039;s story with your friends, family and co-workers on Facebook, Instrgram, Twitter or any social media. Thank you.\n\n gofund.me\/9sgymshg\n\n You can view more pictures of Logan on our website under the TUFF TAILS button: www.roxysk9rescue.org\n\n  \n\n ADOPTION FEE &amp; APPLICATION REQUIRED\n\n Roxy&#039;s K-9 Rescue does not have a shelter, all of our foster dogs are raised in foster homes.

Oshie has videos showing his ball\/toy and hunt drive for any handlers or working homes that would like to adopt him. Oshie is not fazed by new places and has no concerns for loud noises like fireworks or thunder storms. Oshie will even dive into a pool for his toys and would likely make a fun dock diving partner. He is very intense with his toys and will snatch toys out of hands. He is still working on his out command and does not release toys easily. Oshie is working on obedience and agility skills in his foster home.\n\nOshie is dog selective and would do best as an only dog or in a home willing to rotate him with other dogs. He would do OK with another dog if the owner is local to San Antonio and willing to work with the MMK9 trainers to help him settle in.

Giggle giggle&quot;.  But I&#039;m no Poodle or Toto guy I&#039;m smooth coat so why would I need a hair cut? Let me tell ya....snip snip meant losing my thingamagiggies, my man stuff, my you knows!

The only thing bigger than my 85 pound bod is my HEART, I&#039;m not even sure how it fits in my chest. I enjoy going on walks, but doing the cuddles with my foster people, that&#039;s my main hobby. My first 5\/6 years were forgettable, it wasn&#039;t a waggy lifestyle, I was tied and crated 24\/7 and my only free time was to breed. I never got the people cuddles that my heart yearned for.\n\nI had mange, heartworms, and malnourishes, but now I&#039;m on the medicine and almost completely better.  True to a dog&#039;s spirit, I hold zero grrrrudges and love dogs and humans. Sometimes small humans age 3 and 8 come over and they rub all over me, I love that, it&#039;s like where have you been my whole life??? I met a cat one time and had to get real close to sniff and figure out what it was, you see I&#039;m partially blind so my sniffer is my best way to &quot;see&quot;. My eyes have to be cleaned daily, but Foster Mom says I&#039;m the good boy for my drops. I&#039;m also potty trained and crate trained. Sometimes I eat my toys, so you&#039;ll need to get very strong toys that don&#039;t fit all the way in my mouth. I do have scars on my neck that are reminders of my sad times, but my spirit is fully intact (unlike my you know parts) and I want to share my loves and kisses with you.

We went to a San Antonio Rampage hockey game, and there he was, under our car at the SBC Center when we went to leave. We just had to take him home. He was very skinny and hungry and very scared. We brought him home October 26, 2013. He looks like a lab, but is not quite as big as most of the labs I have had. and his is brown with a white patch on his tummy. But my guess would be he has some lab in him. When we took him to the vet the following week, he estimated he was probably around 4 months old. So we approximate his birthday July-ish of 2013. Rampage still shows some signs of being abandoned or hurt by whomever left him in the SBC center parking lot. It took him a while to get used to people, and he scarfs down every drop of food when it hits the bowl. After being with us for almost 4 years, he has become very loving and comfortable. He is still scared of new people. He does not show aggression toward them at all, he just runs away and hides. However, he does show affection toward frequent visitors, such as our parents, siblings, and nieces &amp; nephews. So we are confident he will become comfortable is his new home quickly.

He came to us when he was 10 years old. I felt sorry for him and his owner. The guy that owned him had him since he was a puppy. He had recently gotten married and Cooper was unable to transition into a family with two small children. He was totally stressed out and snapping. Now I know what my answer would have been, but the guy was committed to making his marriage work, so Cooper had to go.\n\nHe had a real rough transition at first. He hated being at the facility. I took him my house, and he still wasn&#039;t happy. For the first six months he barked constantly. One day he followed me to the kennel and met the puppies. From then on he found his place in the world. He rules the quarantine room. He set up shop in a bottom kennel and he supervises al the workers and volunteers. He is happy as a lark. He loves the new puppies. He wants to babysit. When I was taking pictures, he kept getting on the table to make sure the babies were ok.\n\nI&#039;m not sure that Cooper would be a good candidate at this point for a new home, unless the person had a lot of patience and love to give him. He would really appreciate people sponsoring him. He still gets all the special treatment our adoptable dogs get. Every month he gets heartworm preventative, he gets a Bravecto pill every 90 days and he gets treats and toys. We are committed to letting him have a happy life, but as he ages his care will be more costly."

I had a back injury, likely due to genetics, and I had the surgery to fix it. After I rehabbed, I can walk again. I love to rip apart my stuffed toys, run around with the other foster dogs and sit on my foster parent&#039;s laps. As if my good looks weren&#039;t enough, I am pretty well housetrained. I am quiet and easy going. My favorite place to hang out is in the kitchen because that is where the snacks live. Meeting new people is no problem for me because I am friendly and charming. Having someone home with me all the time would be a dream come true, but I can certainly nap while you go to work if that means more snacks and toys, but I will need attention and love when you come home.

I came to DDRT in 2017 when my parent got sick and couldn&#039;t take care of me any longer. My current foster family has taken great care of me but I am looking for my forever home.\n\nMost of my day is keeping company with the humans in the house. I like to sit in laps while they read or watch TV. I will &quot;talk&quot; to them and let them know if I need to go out, or when I&#039;m ready to come back in, if my water bowl is empty, or if I want to play. I&#039;d rather be the only dog in the house and keep the humans all to myself, but if I do have to share the home with another dog, they need to be little like me.\n\nSee, there are things in my life that scare me just a little - like big dogs, certain noises, and laminate or hardwood floors. The noise and texture on my feet doesn&#039;t feel so good. I prefer the carpet and tile. I know that sounds kinda silly, but at my age, a guy knows what he wants!\n\nI would love to spend my days on the couch snoozing and taking naps, watching TV with you, and getting belly rubs! If you are older, like me, at home most of the time, or like watching TV too - you could be my forever home!\n\nIf you would like to meet this handsome, snuggly, lap guy, please fill out an application for Romeo Too today!\n\nLove dachshunds and not ready to adopt or circumstances won&#039;t permit having a dog?

And boy does he have a story behind him. Tyson and his 9 siblings were born in my home after I rescued his very pregnant mother, her very pregnant daughter and another daughter just 6 months old. They had been dumped in a local park here in San Antonio, Texas. It was freezing cold and raining outside.\nHis mother gave birth about 3 days after I got her and her daughter gave birth the very next week. A different rescue took in the pregnant daughter and the 6 month old daughter.\nAll of the puppies came out very different but healthy and happy. You know a female dog can become impregnated by up to 7 different males and surely this is what happened to Tyson&#039;s mother Paris. Miss Paris really had a diverse group of babies!!!!\nTyson was adopted out by a family with kids and even though he was raised inside my home, they kept him outside. He escaped his fence and got hit by a car. Sadly the car that hit him left him there until Animal Control Services (ACS) our city shelter picked him up very injured. He lay all evening and night in a bed of ants that bite him all over. That car really hit him hard.\nThank goodness for microchips, ACS notified me that they had one of my dogs. When I went to pick up Tyson, I was shocked at his injuries. I immediately took him to my vet and he spent a week there before coming home to heal even more.\nTyson endured several surgeries and he is back to being a normal dog. He is happy, friendly and loving, also very obedient. Tyson was not returned to his adoptive family because they were not able to pay the enormous vet fees for his surgeries and care. So I am trying to find the right forever home for Tyson.\nTyson does run and jump, plays chase, wrestles and has no limitations. His back leg is does not bend completely because he had a steel rod in place for longer than normal to help the bones heal to prevent amputation.\nThis is a dog with a very playful and sweet personality; he loves everyone and gets along with other dogs very well.\nI have attached pictures of his injuries, his mother &amp; litter mates and current pictures of Tyson. I plan on posting a video of him soon so you can see him in action and know he has no limitations. Most of all Tyson loves kids and some human attention.\nHe loves the camera; he weighs 37 pounds and a mixture of basset hound, beagle and who knows what else.\nYou can view more pictures on our website: www.roxysk9rescue.org\nADOPTION FEE &amp; APPLICATION REQUIRED\nRoxy&#039;s K-9 Rescue does not have a shelter, all of our foster dogs are raised in foster homes.

He was in a great deal of pain yet put in prozac, instead of getting the care for his back he needed. After he started acting out, due to pain, his &#039;family&#039; got rid of him. How very sad for this little boy.\n\nUPDATE from Charlie&#039;s foster Mama 2.28.2017 &quot;\nCharlie is still looking for his forever home. He needs a very special, patient, super duper doggie knowledgeable human. He gets along great with other dogs and doesn&#039;t mind cats. Because Charlie&#039;s medical condition went neglected for so long, he has conditioned himself to act out a little. He wants love and cuddles on his terms. Please share this boy, or make a donation to\n\n#\n\nIOnceWasLostAnimalAdvocacy\n\nbecause they&#039;ve taken on Charlie full time. I can only foster him every once in a while. If we could send him to more heat therapy sessions that would help him. He also needs supplements for his skin allergies. Poor little pumpkin, he really is a good boy. He minds so well.\n&quot;\n\nWe are happy we have him because it turns out he has bone spurs in his back so he was in a bunch of pain. He is regularly seeing a chiropractor and is making good progress.\n\nBecause of this pain, Charlie can sometimes be a little naughty toward strangers or towards commotion. If his needs are understood, Charlie will be a fantastic little buddy.\n\nCharlie needs a home that will be devoted to his special needs and will understand who he is. If this is all in place, Charlie is a little sweet cutie pie who is a pleasure to be around.\n\nCharlie LOVES other doggies and really really LOVES car rides!!!!\n\nCharlie&#039;s trainer says he&#039;s &quot;very smart&quot; Charlie&#039;s foster mom says Charlie says &quot;\n\nI LOVE car rides they bring me such joy. I want the whole world to see. I am learning that this world has so much love to offer and that I don&#039;t have to be so unsure about everyone.&quot; &amp; &quot;I&#039;m learning so much thanks to all my angels for making sure I am given another chance.&quot;\n\nIf you might be the special home Charlie needs, please message us to schedule a time to meet this little boy. \u2665\u2665\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nCharlie seriously needs a home that can respect and understand his back issues. He has bone spurs that cause him pain.\n\nFor the most part he&#039;s adorable, not to mention the cutest thing ever :o), but he will bite if his space isn&#039;t respected. He truly needs a home that will give him space and only pet him when he requests it.\n\nIn other words, he isn&#039;t a snuggly little thing. He simply needs a home that will give him kindness, love, healthy food, gentle care and understanding. Also, no kiddos.\n\nHe LOVES other dogs and would also be good with cats. The best home for him would have another dog, who the humans can snuggle with and pet, along with Charlie, who would be in a home where he feels safe but can kind of be on the outskirts of the family unit.\n\nWe would be ecstatic to find a home for him. It just needs to be the right home.\n\nWe do have other small adoptables, who Charlie regularly hangs out with. Adopting him along with one of his friends would be a win-win. The new family would have a doggie they could snuggle with, Charlie would have his buddy AND he would have a safe, loving home to call his."

She thinks I am a Chippet because she says I have a lean body, long legs and the personality of a Whippet but my face looks like a Chihuahua. I think I am more like a short Whippet because I am quiet and docile and I am quite content to curl up on the couch all day. But when I get out in the yard, I come alive and have lots of energy and I can run really fast. I am a little shy and it takes me some time to familiarize with a stranger but, once acquainted, I will be my usual friendly and social self. I have a very sensitive nature so I would be unhappy in a large family with lots of children as chaos makes me anxious. My foster mom says I would be a perfect dog for a single person or empty nesters because I am not rowdy and rambunctious like some other dogs. Because I have a very thin coat and not much body fat, I like to find a warm spot in the house and will settle in as long as it is close enough to you. I don\u2019t mind being out in the cold as long as I am moving or running, but it would certainly be cruel to leave me outside for extended periods of time in cold weather.\n\nMona is available for adoption with Saving Grace Dog Rescue of San Antonio.

Sparky&#039;s foster mom says he&#039;s one of the most cuddly dogs she&#039;s ever known and has the perfect activity level. He enjoys long walks or short jogs, but he doesn&#039;t need to be constantly burning off extra energy. He can also entertain himself and he loves to toss his toys in the air and then go track them down. He also enjoys a round of tug of war and kind of playing fetch - Sparky will bring you a toy, you throw it, he will go sit with it for a while, then bring you a different toy, or just throw the toy to himself because why not? Feel free to try to teach him the rest of the rules of the game! Sparky also has excellent manners in the home. He&#039;s house and crate-trained but does great left alone outside of one and hasn&#039;t show any destructive tendencies. But he really prefers having his favorite people around, even if he&#039;s just chilling nearby while they work. Sparky takes some time to warm up to new people, but once he trusts you, he&#039;s as loyal and kind as can be. He&#039;s very affectionate and loves to curl up with his favorite humans and definitely thinks he&#039;s a lap dog. He loves to lay his head in his person&#039;s lap while they stroke his head or just snuggle on the bed or couch. If there&#039;s only a tiny little space there for him, Sparky says he can make it work! He also walks well on leash and knows &#039;sit&#039; and &#039;come&#039;.

His interests include fetch, swimming, fetch, treats, fetch, and gently leaning into your leg for pets. We should also mention that he loves playing fetch and will regularly do leaps and flips in the air trying to catch the ball. And he&#039;s really great at bringing the ball back to you and dropping it. If he thinks you don&#039;t see the ball on the ground, he&#039;ll politely pick it up and set it in your lap. Rio manages to keep the game going with even the laziest of tennis ball throwers! True to his name, Rio also really LOVES being in the water! Whether you&#039;re hosing him off or taking him for a dip in a pool or creek, he&#039;ll take all the water time he can get. And while he is incredibly energetic when playing with a ball or in the water, when he&#039;s all tuckered out, he&#039;s happy to hang out with his person and snuggling. Rio can be aloof with people he doesn&#039;t know, but he warms up quickly and before long he&#039;s asking for belly rubs and cuddles. Rio&#039;s a big guy, but he is very easy to walk on leash and enjoys going a nice quiet walk around the neighborhood, taking in all the sights and smells while staying by your side at a nice pace. He&#039;s also a smart pup who sits politely for treats and recently became TOP Dog Ready, which means he has already learned all the skills in his training plan in APA!&#039;s Total Obedience Program. The Total Obedience Program (TOP) is modeled after the AKC&#039;s Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test. As a TOP dog, Rio has a personalized training plan and works with a volunteer trainer several times a week to help him learn the skills to become the best dog he can be! Dogs in the program learn skills including sitting calmly when approached by strangers, calmly walking past another dog, staying in a sit or down until told &#039;free,&#039; and coming when called. In addition, Rio has also learned &#039;Place&#039;. Rio has worked hard to become a wonderful companion, and as a part of APA&#039;s Total Obedience Program you can work with APA staff to continue to build a training relationship with Rio after adoption and master all the TOP dog skills together.

My name is Socks and I am a leggy, loving, adorable boy who loves to hit the trail and snuggle with my humans. I was found abandoned at only 5 months old and have lived at a rescue kennel ever since.\n\nI&#039;ll tell you a secret. When my trainer lady sat down to make this post, she was a little inspired by a hilarious and heartwarming page called The Least Adoptable Dog in the World. You see, I&#039;m a bit of a handful.\n\nBUT, I&#039;m also a total catch in a lot of ways. In fact, she&#039;s known much more difficult dogs than me and they&#039;re all happy and thriving in h\nomes now. I just need the right human who sees the exceptional boy I am and realizes I&#039;m their souldog. We both feel very confident that I am absolutely someone&#039;s souldog.\n\n&lt;3\n\nSo to start, here are some AWESOME things about me:\n\n*Rockstar trail dog &amp; running buddy. For real, I&#039;m an active Austinite&#039;s dream boy!\n\n*No reactivity issues to people, dogs, cats, small mammals - I wanna be social!\n\n*Super affectionate and loving, affection calms me down when I have my moments.\n\n&lt;3\n\n*I love toys. I love fetch. I love gnawables. I&#039;m learning puzzle toys. I love you.\n\n*I ride nicely in the car.\n\n*I&#039;m working on being an adventure boy and think water is pretty sweet.\n\n*I come with training support.\n\nNow why do I need a special home?\n\n*I am genuinely high energy. Couple that with the fact that I&#039;m a young adult male and have lived in a kennel environment for way too long and I&#039;m now also a guy with some arousal issues and stress related acting out.\n\n*I can be mouthy. I have gotten SO much better with this but see above, overarousal, be it stress or excitement or anxiousness, brings it out. Usually it&#039;s no biggie to redirect now, I often even redirect myself, but the stickier the situation, the more mouthiness you might see and moving to a new home is pretty sticky!\n\n*I&#039;m not exactly a pro at indoor life but I am coachable. During my life indoors practice, I&#039;ve responded super well to potty training and hey, paws don&#039;t go on the counter type stuff. I also overcame something really scary called stairs. But I definitely need more practice and may still do stuff like steal a hat off the shelf bc it looks like a toy.\n\n*I&#039;ve lived my young life out in the country so sometimes new experiences and city life make me nervous. I&#039;m resilient though and I look to my human for cues so I know this won&#039;t be a biggie. I&#039;m already going to more adventurous places and doing great!\n\nMy trainer lady with\nDog Possible\nis helping find my human so you can email her at amy@dogpossibleaustin.com and she will hook us up!\n\nYou can also visit my very own Facebook page, A Special Home for a Dog Named Socks and click on my photo story to learn more about me: https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/SocksMcGruff\/\n\nI hope I steal your heart!\n"	"https:\/\/dl5zpyw5k3jeb.cloudfront.net\/photos\/pets\/38686540\/2\/?bust=1555111300"	"https:\/\/dl5zpyw5k3jeb.cloudfront.net\/photos\/pets\/38686540\/2\/?bust=1555111300","https:\/\/dl5zpyw5k3jeb.cloudfront.net\/photos\/pets\/38686540\/1\/?bust=1555111299","https:\/\/dl5zpyw5k3jeb.cloudfront.net\/photos\/pets\/38686540\/3\/?bust=1555111301"	"adoptable"	"Spay\/Neuter","Shots Current"	null	true	true	true	null	null	false	I Once Was Lost Animal Advocacy	not-adopted

With his smoky brown eyes, he looks up to you for guidance in every situation. With a subtle cue from you, he&#039;ll show you all his skills. This sweet boy will keep you balanced - lots of one-on-one time snuggling on the couch and a fond farewell when you go out to visit with friends.

And this was not a made up pretend scenario on the John Quinones show this was our real life.  Lucky for us, a fella was there and said he would foster us so that we could find a new place to call home instead of the eeeek alternative.\n\nMy name is Sandy, I am the one with the flappy ears and dabbles of grey fur on my muzzle, I am 10 years old and mostly golden Labrador Retriever mixed with Shepherd weigh about 60 pounds.  I earned each of my gray whiskers, I got a new one each time I did something sweet for my human, so there are LOTS there.  I am daughter to the smaller of us. My Mommy is named Ginger, obviously, named for her pretty color.  She is my actual blood Mommy and 15 years old. \n\nWe have been twogether for 10 whole years, so God\u2019s Dogs Rescue very much wants us to be adopted as a package deal, since our world has already been turned inside out, they want us to have some consistency. We are sweet sweet gals, easy on a leash, very soft to touch, and already house trained. We do wonderful around other dogs and really just want a soft place to spend the time we have left.

When he gives you a little hopeful tail wag, it&#039;ll be all over. If you&#039;re ready, come meet him!"

A first-rate conversationalist, if you say something to Brooks, he will answer you! This boy&#039;s got opinions and he&#039;s not shy about sharing them. Though he&#039;s not much of a barker, Brooks will go around harrumphing and grumbling and huffing his opinion on every situation. His expressive eyes also have a lot to say: &#039;You&#039;re my best friend,&#039; &#039;Where&#039;s the treat?&#039; and &#039;Let&#039;s go jump in the lake!&#039; A sporty senior, Brooks is usually pretty mellow in the home, but he perks up on walks and loves when they go for a long time. He&#039;s also 100% water bug and he will launch himself into the lake fearlessly and without hesitation. He loves to retrieve sticks and especially loves it when you jump into the lake with him. Whether it&#039;s swimming, hiking or jogging, Brooks is happy to match your pace. He just loves to be outside in the sunshine and he relishes every moment adventuring with his person. As athletic as he is, Brooks is also the perfect, chilled-out house guest. Calm, house-trained and all around well-behaved in the home, Brooks is very good at keeping himself occupied, content to settle in with a good rawhide and some toys. But his favorite activity at home is getting scratches, particularly butt scratches, and you can easily buy his loyalty with them. And treats. Brooks will do just about anything for a treat. Brooks adores attention, and when his person greets houseguests warmly and invites them inside, Brooks takes a couple of sniffs, then expects them to give him butt scratches too. He also enjoys playing tug of war, and when he gets excited, he&#039;ll jump around on his hind legs and howl a little bit. He&#039;s up for playing with toys if you are, but otherwise is very content to snooze for hours at a time, especially if he is curled up next to you. This spirited guy is also thriving in APA!&#039;s Total Obedience Program. The Total Obedience Program (TOP) is modeled after the AKC&#039;s Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test. As a TOP dog, Brooks has a personalized training plan and works with a volunteer trainer several times a week to help him learn the skills to become the best dog he can be! Brooks is learning skills like sit and down, walking nicely on leash, sitting calmly when approached by strangers or other dogs, staying in a sit or down until told &#039;free,&#039; coming when called and &#039;Place&#039;, which means he will go to a specific place in your home on command. Once he successfully completes all the skills on his training plan, Brooks will be considered TOP Dog Ready! Brooks is working hard to become a wonderful companion, and as a part of APA&#039;s Total Obedience Program you can work with APA staff to continue to build a training relationship with him after adoption and master all the TOP dog skills together. Check out a video on APA&#039;s CGC program, on which the TOP was based: https:\/\/vimeo.com\/89434193 This adorable, athletic cuddlebug is sure to bring lots of love and laughter to your home. Come meet him and we promise you&#039;ll have plenty to talk about!"

Buck is estimated to be about 1 1\/2 yrs old with some rough times behind him- obvious from his embedded collar injury and the possible burn scar on his rear leg. Our best guess at breed is a Lab\/Hound mix. Buck is 60 lbs of happy energy and he gets along well with other dogs and is potty trained and crate trained. Buck loves to meet new people! His enthusiasm leads him to jump up to greet people so we are working on manners. He would be perfect for an active person and would be a great running partner! He is a very smart dog so he needs to keep his mind stimulated. He has already learned sit and down and we are working on roll over. He is easily motivated so additional training or training classes would be perfect for him! He needs a secure fence and supervision while outside. Because he is a big puppy he would do best in a home with no small kids and other medium to large dogs. While he is good with other dogs he does bark when on a leash at unfamiliar dogs which can sound a little intimidating, but he is just so excited and wants to play. He has a goofy personality. His favorite snack is bananas and he likes to play in the bathtub!\n\nBuck is available for adoption with Saving Grace Dog Rescue of San Antonio. The adoption fee is $150.00. An adoption application, home visit and adoption contract are all required. All dogs are spayed\/neutered, up to date on vaccinations appropriate for their age, microchipped, and wormed for internal and external parasites. If you would like more information or an adoption application, please email us at sgdrsa@outlook.com.\n\nPlease note that visual breed identification in rescue dogs is unreliable so for most of our dogs we are only GUESSING at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each dog as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our dogs based on personality, not by breed label.\n"	"https:\/\/dl5zpyw5k3jeb.cloudfront.net\/photos\/pets\/40535118\/1\/?bust=1543972069"	"https:\/\/dl5zpyw5k3jeb.cloudfront.net\/photos\/pets\/40535118\/1\/?bust=1543972069","https:\/\/dl5zpyw5k3jeb.cloudfront.net\/photos\/pets\/40535118\/2\/?bust=1543907389","https:\/\/dl5zpyw5k3jeb.cloudfront.net\/photos\/pets\/40535118\/3\/?bust=1543907397"	"adoptable"	"House trained","Spay\/Neuter"	null	null	true	null	null	null	false	Saving Grace Dog Rescue of San Antonio	not-adopted

No more outside in a kennel, raising pups or anxiously anticipating the next forced breeding. This little fawn sweetheart is only 4 or 5 years old and this world of touches and treats and laps is brand new. She has been fully vetted, spayed and finished the routine preventive medications for dogs like her from the Palm Valley area. Remarkably she is heartworm negative.\n\nMulberry soaks up love and attention like a sponge. She loves people, even little people, and cuddling is about as good as it gets. Mulberry did not need to develop social skills with dogs or people in the puppy mill, but she is catching up quickly in her foster home. She does not like dominant male dogs (no surprise there) but is learning that some dogs are OK, like the submissive male Boxer she lives with now.\n\nMulberry is house, crate and leash trained. Her experienced foster mom explains \u201c It is hard not to give in to her soulful brown eyes and pixie face when it is time for discipline but she responds well when told no. She does have a stubborn streak so repetition and patience are key.\u201d This little darling needs a loving family who can say no when needed and still shower her with love, attention, inclusion and security. Goodness knows she earned it.\n\n\nMore info coming soon"	"https:\/\/dl5zpyw5k3jeb.cloudfront.net\/photos\/pets\/40549505\/1\/?bust=1514680727"	"https:\/\/dl5zpyw5k3jeb.cloudfront.net\/photos\/pets\/40549505\/1\/?bust=1514680727"	"adoptable"	"House trained","Spay\/Neuter","Shots Current"	null	null	true	null	null	null	false	Austin Boxer Rescue	not-adopted

He&#039;s also a very playful guy, and loves to run, run, and run some more. If Ziggy was a muppet, he&#039;d definitely be the Cookie Monster! This guy lives for treats. He&#039;ll do just about anything for one and because he&#039;s so incredibly smart, we do mean just about anything. We&#039;re convinced that Ziggy can learn anything that doesn&#039;t require opposable thumbs. And he&#039;s so good on leash that sometimes he&#039;s so focused on his handler (and the treats), that he&#039;ll walk right into fences. Ziggy watches his person closely to figure out what game they can play next or what will be asked of him. He&#039;s currently learning to play a &#039;shell game&#039; of finding a treat in various containers. This game is particularly fun for him because he has to use his nose. That&#039;s another thing that Ziggy likes - he loves to follow his nose to make sure that he smells all the smells!! This smart pup is also thriving in APA!&#039;s Total Obdience Program and recently became TOP Dog Ready, which means he has already learned all the skills in his training plan. The Total Obedience Program (TOP) is modeled after the AKC&#039;s Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test. As a TOP Dog, Ziggy has a personalized training plan and works with a volunteer trainer several times a week to help him learn the skills to become the best dog he can be! Dogs in the program learn skills including sit and down, walking nicely on leash, sitting calmly when approached by strangers, calmly walking past another dog, staying in a sit or down until told &#039;free,&#039; and coming when called. In addition, Ziggy has also learned &#039;Place&#039;. Ziggy has worked hard to become a wonderful companion, and as a part of APA&#039;s Total Obedience Program you can work with APA staff to continue to build a training relationship with Ziggy after adoption and master all the TOP dog skills together. Check out a video on APA&#039;s CGC program, on which the TOP was based: https:\/\/vimeo.com\/89434193 Ziggy is a great example of what training and love can do for a dog. Because Ziggy is so smart, he can sometimes get himself into trouble and needs a home with someone who is comfortable setting boundaries. In return, this goofy boy will melt your heart and empty your treat pouch. Come meet him!"

Both about 7-8 pounds. According to former owner Petey was attacked by a raccoon at his feeding bowl as a young pup. Vet says his eye is healthy, doesn&#039;t need to be removed, but obviously there is sight loss. They were raised in a pack situation (are in one here), so do well with other dogs. They are also good with cats (caveat is my cats DO NOT RUN... they rule the house with iron paws). \nBoth are very affectionate, but Petey is the shy one. Former owner told a vague story of Petey missing for three minths and some getting him back in rough shape. He was matted and will slink around army crawling if he is unsure. Otherwise he will roll on you like a cat and beg to be held. Mickey is quite feisty and will make sure he gets his attention. I crate and feed them together. They are pretty easy. \nI am afraid small\/rowdy toddlers and children may be too much for Petey. Both cannot tolerate rough handling. \nBoth acted as if I were drowning them during possible first bath of their lives, and being groomed is also daunting. They need patient handling.

He constantly wants to snuggle and when he sees his people coming, he wags his little tail with all his might! He loves to be by your side and will lay his big adorable head on your leg Or lean his whole body against you. His APA! friends rave about his kisses and how speedy and sneaky he is with them. Achilles is great on leash and loves to go on long walks. He&#039;s also a very patient guy and is perfectly content to let you stop and chat with people along the way. He&#039;s not particularly interested in other dogs and seems to prefer just spending his time with his people, but he has become enamored with playing fetch, if fetch means running around with the ball in his mouth. He hasn&#039;t figured out the other half of fetch yet, but we&#039;re working on it. Achilles is also working on being the best dog he can be in APA!&#039;s Total Obedience Program. The Total Obedience Program (TOP) is modeled after the AKC&#039;s Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test. As a TOP dog, Achilles has a personalized training plan and works with a volunteer trainer several times a week to help him learn skills like sit and down, walking nicely on leash, sitting calmly when approached by strangers or other dogs, staying in a sit or down until told &#039;free,&#039; and coming when called. Once Achilles successfully completes all the skills on his training plan he will be considered TOP Dog Ready. Achilles is working hard to become a wonderful companion, and as a part of APA&#039;s Total Obedience Program you can work with APA! staff to continue to build a training relationship with Achilles after adoption and master all the TOP dog skills together. Check out a video on APA&#039;s CGC program, on which the TOP was based: https:\/\/vimeo.com\/89434193 This easy-going pooch is a joy to be around and can&#039;t wait to meet his family.

Thaddeus loves meeting people and always greets them gently and politely. For as much as he loves treats, he is sure to take those gently too. There is not too much Type A in his personality. He loves to go on walks and is great on leash. He is well-behaved in the home and knows how to use a doggie door. He is not super cuddly but he will occasionally lay his head in your lap.

She has big paws and a goofy little trot and definitely thinks she&#039;s a lap dog. Jasmine&#039;s a curious pup and follows her human around the house so she can be in the same room as them. She is always up for any activity and especially loves car rides and napping on the couch with her human. She is house-trained and does extremely well in the crate when she&#039;s home alone. Jasmine is quiet, affectionate and extremely treat-motivated, which makes training easy. Jasmine is also in APA!&#039;s Total Obedience Program. The Total Obedience Program (TOP) is modeled after the AKC&#039;s Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test. As a TOP dog, Jasmine has a personalized training plan and works with a volunteer trainer several times a week to help her learn the skills to become the best dog she can be! Jasmine is learning skills like sit and down, walking nicely on leash, sitting calmly when approached by strangers or other dogs, staying in a sit or down until told &#039;free,&#039; and coming when called. Once Jasmine successfully completes all the skills on her training plan, she will be considered TOP Dog Ready! Jasmine is working hard to become a wonderful companion, and as a part of APA&#039;s Total Obedience Program you can work with APA staff to continue to build a training relationship with Jasmine after adoption and master all the TOP dog skills together. Check out a video on APA&#039;s CGC program, on which the TOP was based: https:\/\/vimeo.com\/89434193 Jasmine is a really special and loving girl and will provide a lifetime of love and loyalty.

If you are interested in adopting Calvin, please contact Stray Acres at 512-525-4710.\n\nLike us on facebook: https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/stray.acres.9\/Application Link: http:\/\/strayacressanctuary.org\/Adoption-And-Agreement-Application.htmlEmail us at: sstrayacressanctuary@gmail.com 8\/27\/18 10:55 AM"	"https:\/\/dl5zpyw5k3jeb.cloudfront.net\/photos\/pets\/41373411\/1\/?bust=1524375629"	"https:\/\/dl5zpyw5k3jeb.cloudfront.net\/photos\/pets\/41373411\/1\/?bust=1524375629","https:\/\/dl5zpyw5k3jeb.cloudfront.net\/photos\/pets\/41373411\/2\/?bust=1524375643"	"adoptable"	"Spay\/Neuter","Shots Current"	null	null	null	null	null	null	false	Stray Acres Sanctuary and Animal Rescue	not-adopted

He has reached his adult weight and height. This guy has my respect. I pulled him from a high kill shelter in San Antonio, Texas when he was almost 3 months old. He was very emaciated and his rear leg had with a bone sticking out and broken in several places. Someone had abused him. But Scooter was still happy and loved to be held and his sprits had not been broken. He has been a trooper from day one, never making a sound even though he was in a lot of pain.\nEven though his leg was so bad; the vet considered amputation but decided to watch the bones heal. They leg healed but he has a limp that doesn\u2019t stop him from running and jumping. His room is upstairs and he bounces up the stairs all the time. And he loves for me to play chase with him in the backyard. His complete medical records and x-rays will come with him at the time of adoption.\nSomeone else named him early on but his name Scooter so deserves, he is a SCOOTER. He only barks when he is talking to you or to alert me that someone is near our gate in the backyard. He bounces around still like a puppy and just a very happy guy. He gets along with everyone.\nScooter will let a dog cuddle with him, eat out of his bowl and share his toys. To sum Scooter up, he is just a fun loving guys who smiles all the time and gives you love every day. You cannot help but smile back at him and laugh because he sits there with a goofy grin on his face looking at you until you do smile and tell him something good. This is the type of dog that you want to come home to, he is a best friend best buddy pal for sure.\nHe has a beautiful black wavy coat and he does not tend to shed with regular baths, he will sit still for a bath, then he goes and takes a long nap. J There is nothing better to Scooter than having his head scratched and getting some attention from him human. And a rawhide, he chews on them and plays with them! He is not demanding and very low maintenance. He eats regular dry food but he watches to see if you might share your food with him!!!! While he has been in my care, he has helped heal the soul of other rescue dogs brought into my home that didn\u2019t have the best start in life. Scooter just seems to know what is going on.\nHis best friend was another bigger white border collie who only has 3 legs. Bradley was hit by a car. Scooter instantly took to him and became his hearing dog and totally took care of Bradley. Sadly Bradley got adopted and Scooter has been searching for another best buddy.\nADOPTION FEE &amp; APPLICATION REQUIRED\n\nRoxy&#039;s K-9 Rescue does not have a shelter, all of our dogs are raised in foster homes.

All have been adopted. Kaily appears to be a true Labrador Retriever but mixed with something. Kaily had no microchip and I guess she ran away for a better life. Kaily ate through her rope and tie-down from her home and ended up at one of my feeding stations very pregnant. She gave birth to 9 puppies almost 1 week later. Very smart girl, I guess Kaily decided she would not give birth while tied up. She had on a huge black collar and chain that she broke to escape her previous home. That awful collar has been removed for a more stylist one. As soon as she had her babies, I climbed the fence and found her 2 day old babies laying filth, dirt, trash, it was not very nice and they were covered already with fleas. This may have been Kaily&#039;s first litter, she tried to hide them from the elements but she didn&#039;t do a very good job, they were completely exposed to the wind and rain. 1 little puppy didn&#039;t make it. But the other 8 looked good.\nKaily ended up being very happy to be rescued, loaded up and taken to a clean, safe home where she could receive love &amp; attention.\nKaily is 2.5 years old and currently weighs 68 lbs but she could stand to lose a few pounds. I\u2019m sure with regular walks she would probably lose 10 pounds easily. Kaily has a great personalities, she is very quiet, friendly and gets along with all humans and dogs. Actually her entire litter of puppies were all very quiet, quiet when they played, ate, wrestled, they were just a very calm, chill bunch. Kaily does not get upset, nor is she destructive. She will sleep in her crate but she is fine just sleeping on her doggy bed, she is not destructive. She will play with toys but she would rather have some ear scratches and love from her human and cuddle besides you. She is not a shadow dog, very independent but she keeps an eye on you to make sure you are still there. Her solemn look turns into a smile while she is following you around and she is just close to you, all she wants s to share her love. Kaily is a great, very calm, well behaved young lady and will make a great family pet.\nShe also communicates with you like if she wants to watch TV and it is off she will just sit and stare at the TV until you turn it on. She will also cuddle with you and watch TV together.\nKaily is a Labrador Retriever mix with a bronzy brown coat with black going doing the middle. Now that she knows she is safe and not chained up, she is the perfect little lady. She requires very little maintenance and just wants to be loved. She has 1 male playmate that she is fond of but she is in a home with a variety of foster brothers and sisters. She gets along with small and big dogs, her first roommate upon arriving here was a 4 pound Maltese and he made sure she knew who was boss!! Kaily has a mild demeanor; not aggressive in any area and likes to get out for walks but not demanding of them. Nor does her behavior require that she be walked on a daily basis. Kaily&#039;s coat looks a lot better now than when she was first rescued. Please consider giving Kaily her chance at a forever home. You would be getting a prized family pet by adopting this girl into your home.\nPLEASE VISIT OUR WEBSITE FOR MORE PICTURES: roxysk9rescue.org\nADOPTION FEE &amp; APPLICATION REQUIRED\nRoxy&#039;s K-9 Rescue does not have a shelter, all of our foster dogs are raised in private homes; .

This fun little girl is looking for someone to run and play with, relax and watch movies, shows, commercials, etc ...mainly, just someone to love on her forever and show her she can trust them to keep her safe so she will never be left to fend for herself again!\nJuliet is a 6 yr old chihuahua mix.  Don&#039;t let her age fool you though... she runs and plays like she is half her age!  At only 6.8 lbs, she would be a wonderful addition to the right home.  With her small build, she will be best in a home without really young or very active children though.  She is very curious and loves to find out what is behind every door and in every corner!  She is currently living in a home with lots of playmates close to her own size, a 7 yr old little girl and two adults.  Her favorite way to spend her day is relaxing after chasing her playmates around the yard... more relaxing than chasing, but no one is keeping track!  She is kennel trained (although would probably prefer a couch or bed to call her own), housebroken and learned how to use the doggie door the first day (although with everyone&#039;s small size, is only open during the day when their people are home and can make sure nothing happens while they are outside).  Juliette is nervous in stressful situations and may nip when strangers reach for her.  She is fully vaccinated and heartworm negative. Her adoption fee is $90 and includes her shots, spay and a box of heartgard.  If you are interested in this wonderfully sweet girl, please send your application to myhappytail@yahoo.com.

She gets along with dogs just fine but is pretty shy overall and very timid with men. She\u2019s between 3 and 4 years old now and completely up to date on her vaccinations, including rattlesnake (it needs an annual booster), heartworm medication and flea and tick meds. She is house, crate and leash trained and does not jump up or get on furniture.\n\nMunchkin is still a bit high energy girl with a high  prey drive: no cats, but she is sweet and cuddly too. It is never easy to let go of a loved one, but sometimes doing what is best for them is the right thing to do.

Besides the adorable way she tilts her head as she waits for a treat, the most important thing to know about Cricket is that she is an admirer and collector of toys. Cricket LOVES toys and she always keeps several in her kennel. And she often proudly shows off one to her volunteer visitors. If she passes a toy while on a walk at APA! she must investigate and evaluate. If she were a human, she&#039;d have a whole room &#039;mint in box.&#039; Cricket is good with people of every type, big and small, and is great at meeting strangers. She will walk right up to them for pets but doesn&#039;t jump up on them. Cricket has lived with kids (aged 7 and 10) in foster, and she was very gentle and patient with them. She loved being petted and playing fetch and tug-of-war and also met a lot of the kids&#039; friends and was great with meeting all of them. Cricket&#039;s just a great pup to have around - she&#039;s affectionate without being needy and high energy and playful when you want her to be. She will put her paw up on your to get attention or just lay her head on your lap to let you know it&#039;s time for pets. When indoors, she naps a lot and is happy to relax and lounge about. She has a tendency to sleep in really funny poses - curled up as small as possible like a cat, or on a chair with her head hanging off or sprawled out with her paws daintily crossed, or on her back with her paws in the air. But once she gets outside, her high-energy side comes out, and she loves to go on long hikes or runs or play fetch for as long as you can stand it. With her expressive eyes, constant wagging tail and big floppy funny ears, Cricket has a lot of personality and seems to exude gratitude anytime her people come near her. Cricket has great manners at home and quickly learned and obeyed which pieces of furniture she was and wasn&#039;t allowed on. She almost never barks in any situation and sleeps through the might in her crate. She walks pretty well with a gentle leader and gives great eye contract to keep those treats coming. In fact, Cricket is such a good training buddy that she recently became CGC Ready, which means she successfully passed the American Kennel Club&#039;s CGC test with her volunteer trainer! To pass the CGC test, a dog must demonstrate obedience and general reliability in real world situations. A CGC-Ready dog knows sit and down, walks nicely on leash, will sit calmly when approached by strangers or another dog, won&#039;t approach people or dogs without permission, greets people appropriately, stays in a sit or down until told &#039;free,&#039; and comes when called. Cricket has been working hard to be a dog you can take anywhere with pride, and as part of APA!&#039;s CGC program you can work with APA to continue to build a training relationship with her after adoption and get officially CGC certified for free! Check out a video about CGC: https:\/\/vimeo.com\/89434193 Cricket but would be great for a single person, couple or family with kids. She would love a backyard romp around in as long as the fence is tall because this Cricket can jump! Cricket has got a lot of love to give, so if you&#039;re looking for a smart, happy, affectionate pup who&#039;s eager to learn and eager to please, come meet her!"

Brindle is learning skills like sit and down, walking nicely on leash, sitting calmly when approached by strangers or other dogs, staying in a sit or down until told &#039;free,&#039; coming when called and &#039;place&#039;, which means he will go to a special place in your home on command.

He was extremely skittish and untrusting and I worked very hard with him to bring him along to where he is now. It makes me so happy to see how far he has come along. He has blossomed from a scared, sad, little dog into a happy, trusting, and extremely affectionate companion. He is still wary of new people (especially men), but quickly warms up and wants to be petted by everyone. He thinks he is a lap dog, and if you will let him he will get up on the bed or couch with you and snuggle for hours! He also loves other dogs. Playing and running in the yard with his buddies brings out the puppy in him! He deserves a home with someone who has the time to give him all the love that he craves and I know that he will be an amazing friend.

At about 40 pounds she\u2019s tiny for a female and even though her broken front leg never healed quite right, she\u2019s game for whatever comes her way. \n\nPenny Lane lives with a couple older kids and regularly entertains her neighbor preschooler. She is dog friendly but needs a little time to get to know them first. She is good with her host male Boxer but we don\u2019t know how she is with cats. Once she knows her fur buddies it\u2019s playtime! Penny Lane is house, crate and leash trained and short walks are fine but she tires on longer walks. Penny is a bit shy with strangers but her fur buddies show her the way so she would do best with a fur buddie or two.  \n\nPenny Lane is a kisser once she gets to know you and be sure she\u2019s safe. She is heartworm positive but routine medication that she has been on for 9 months can take care of that and ABR will help with treatment. She loves her people, her dog buddy, her toys and Boxer burns. So, let her add some joy and smiles to your family.

She\u2019s still a little hesitant to go into the backyard alone, but her love of a sunbath and a stroll around the yard with the oldest Boxer host help her overcome that.  She loves a good rub and grunts her approval for things she likes. Kya is house trained.\n\nThis gentle little girl needs a patient, loving family to help continue her healing. It takes time, structure, love and reassurance to help her learn to trust again so she can blossom into the beautiful, sweet girl she is.

Tavi (also known as Butterbean) is a charmer and whip-smart. He already knows many commands\/words and learns more as his foster mom teaches him.\n\nTavi loves a routine and finds it comforting to know what\u2019s happening (and when) as regards to walks, potty breaks and feeding. This is partly the breed and also due to his blindness, caused by cataracts. \n\nPlease don\u2019t think of Tavi as a \u201cspecial needs\u201d dog; his foster mom believes he has been blind for quite awhile, since he\u2019s very comfortable with his sight loss. He gets to know his home pretty quickly to make his way around and will zero in on your location when you say, \u201ccome\u201d and clap hands. He\u2019s just a regular dog who happens to be blind.\n\nTavish is low energy indoors and sleeps quite a bit. He\u2019s been living in a condominium with his foster mom and is content to sleep in his little bed beside her desk at home during the day with a potty break in early afternoon. (He has also gone to the office with his vacation foster mom and she says he did great there.) He sleeps in his crate\/pen at night for 8+ hours. If you\u2019re gone for a few hours during the day, he\u2019s content to be crated as well.\n\nOutdoors, Tavish is always on a lead and is well-behaved. He loves to walk in the morning after breakfast and again in the early evening for 20-30 minutes. His long legs can keep up with you and being blind, he never bolts. He has a cold weather coat and a rain coat, loves to wear them and isn\u2019t afraid of a bit of weather. Tavi is very comfortable with all of the dogs at the park and in the condo community and their owners remark on how calm Tavish stays around other dogs. Rambunctious puppies who jump on him make Tavi a bit grouchy but he has good boundaries and lets them know to back off. \n\nHe travels well in a car, going to outdoor caf\u00e9s and happy hour and isn\u2019t bothered by noise like music or cars. He\u2019s traveled on a road trip with his foster family, stayed in a hotel for a week and was a perfect guest.\n\nHis teeth were extracted at intake, but he eats small kibble very well. He has been eating a low-fat, high-calorie kibble for several months and is in great health with the softest coat.\n\nTavish has transformed from a malnourished, frightened dog to a beautiful, healthy boy with a sweet personality. He is easy to care for and bonds well to a loving person. He loves to sit beside you on the sofa with his blanket and snooze while you read or watch TV. He\u2019ll be a charming companion beside you for years to come."

I currently weigh about 55 lbs and I still have some growing to do.   \n\n\n\n\n\nI love to play with all of the dogs in my foster home.  I have a ton of energy, so a doggie friend in my new home would be nice with a large place to run and play.  I am too energetic for cats and small children.  In fact, small kids make me nervous, and I tend to get grumbly, so I need to go to a home where there are none.  I am shy when I first meet someone new, but I do warm up pretty quickly.  \n\n\n\n\n\nMy favorite things are Nylabone chew toys and squeaky toys.  I also occasionally will fetch a tennis ball.  But wrestling with my doggie siblings is my favorite.   \n\n\n\n\n\nWhen inside, I like to just chill on my dog bed or hang out in my crate.  I am crate trained, house trained, up to date on vaccines, microchipped and neutered.  I walk well on a leash and ride quietly in the car.  \n\n\n\n\n\nI really would love a home of my own with an active family who will take me on walks or on fun adventures.

He loves to run and jump and sniff and swim and fetch and do all of the wonderful things dogs do. If you are looking to get the most out of all the things Austin has to offer, Toro would be an excellent wing man. Toro gets along well with most of the other dogs in playgroup and is friendly with new people. He&#039;s house-trained, knows sit and is very attentive to everything happening around him. He gives that classic inquisitive head tilt to let you know he is really paying attention. He can be a bit amped when he is first let out of his kennel, because as you can imagine, he doesn&#039;t care to be cooped up. Once he gets some time to stretch his legs, he settles into a more medium pace. And he&#039;s got a sensitive side and isn&#039;t above leaning into you for some pets and loving. The ideal home for Toro would be one with a yard he could chase down lizards in and perhaps another well-matched canine companion to pal around with. Toro has been thriving in APA!&#039;s Total Obedience Program and recently became TOP Dog Ready, which means he has already learned all the skills in his customized training plan. The Total Obedience Program (TOP) is modeled after the AKC&#039;s Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test. As a TOP Dog, Toro works with a volunteer trainer several times a week to help him become the best dog he can be! Dogs in the program learn skills including sit and down, walking nicely on leash, sitting calmly when approached by strangers, calmly walking past another dog, staying in a sit or down until told &#039;free,&#039; coming when called and &#039;Place&#039;, which means he will go to a specific place in your home on command. Toro has worked hard to become a wonderful companion, and as a part of APA&#039;s Total Obedience Program you can work with APA staff to continue to build a training relationship with him after adoption and master all the TOP dog skills together. Check out a video on APA&#039;s CGC program, on which the TOP was based: https:\/\/vimeo.com\/89434193 Toro is for the true dog people out there. Those who appreciate man&#039;s best friend in their full water-splashing, stick-fetching, squirrel-chasing glory. If that&#039;s you, you should definitely meet him!"

We were allowed to run loose and we kinda populated the neighborhood.\n\nHe had 21 of us stashed at his house when he got sick and had to go to the hospital. He thought his son would take care of us, but he didn&#039;t. Lucky for us the mailman realized we were on our own without food or water. The nice people from the Waco shelter came and rescued us.\n\nWe were very scared and didn&#039;t act very nice. They were very concerned and knew we needed help adjusting to our new situation. They called the girls at the ranch and they came in this big bus and got us. All of us. No one was left behind. We were terrified, but very greatful to stay together during the transition. Then we got home and realized we had food and toys, Wow.\n\nI take a little longer to get to know, but I really like attention. I am very loving to the people at the ranch who take care of me. I like treats and will be your best bud if you give me treats. I need a special family with people that will give me time to be the great dog I am.

Dakota is 80 lbs and needs to walk to drop at least 15 lbs off of her. She would love to walk as she is very friendly and likes meeting new people. YES, She likes to get on her hind legs and try to dance, twirling around with a big grin on her face!!!\nThe vet has described her breed as mostly Husky with some Labrador Retriever mixed in and the vet puts her age at 5 years old. She has good solid teeth. There are no medical problems with her and she tested NEGATIVE on her heartworm test -- YIPPEE!!!\nDakota is up to date on her vaccination and rabies shots, she will not need anything until this time 2019, She has also been de-wormed. She is microchipped and her medical records will come with her at the time of adoption. She will need to be on monthly Heartworm Preventative and we can sell you a 6 month supply for $47 so you do not need to pay to have her tested again. Her test results will come in her medical records.\nDakota is in a foster home with 2 other big dogs, a cat and a rabbit and little kids. She gets along with everyone, she has not had 1 incident with any of them. She is low energy and will lay there and watch everyone doing their thing and she is totally fine with that. Give her a chewbone and that has made her day! I&#039;m not too sure about her playing with toys, you&#039;ll have to speak to her foster mom about that.\nDakota would love to find her forever home. Dakota is such a sweetheart and always full of smiles but most of all she gets along with adults and children of all ages. Every night she tucks my school age boys into bed and sleeps next to them all night.\nShe is brownish-red in color with white paws and white face. When it&#039;s feeding time she gets very excited and loves to show it with her friendly dances. She also shows excitement when you put water inside her small pool that she plays in. Dakota enjoys playing fetch, having her belly rubbed, going for walks and loves to cuddle.\nWhen she goes out to potty she walks the yard, sometimes lays out there to sunbath and comes back to the sliding glass door to be let in. She is completely house trained and trustworthy to be left alone without having to be crated. She is crate trained but she doesn&#039;t bother anything that is not hers.\nShe is house trained and will go to the back door letting you know that it is potty time. When Dakota is outside during the night she gets scared and will cry until brought inside. She is strictly an indoor family pet type of dog.\nOverall, Dakota is a friendly, sweet and loving older dog who wants to share this with a good forever family.\nDakota rides good in the car, doesn&#039;t mind getting her nails done or taking a bath. Surprisingly for her breed, there is very little shedding.\nDakota would do good in an apartment because she is so calm, a non barker and just a gentle girl. She would love to have her owner human person to love her so she doesn&#039;t have to share the love.\nDakota is a great companion, she is best friends with a female German Shepherd who had to go to the vet and Dakota was sad all day until her friend came home. She is also kind of motherly with other dogs.\nPlease email us at roxysrescue@yahoo.com if you&#039;d like to speak to her foster mom, set up a meet and greet for adoption or have any interest in her.

I am a pure bred Boxer. I am about 3 yrs old. There were some people that used me for breeding. They put me in a pen with these other male dogs and they beat me up bad. It was so terrible. So they turned me in to ACS. Then this nice rescue saved me. I was so scared when I saw all these other dogs. I was so afraid they would beat me up too, that I growled and barked at the dogs especially the other boys. I am now learning that not all the other dogs are mean. I keep hearing the people say how sweet I am and how proud of me they are. They say I am a big teddy bear whatever that is. I do know I quit barking at the other dogs. I would prefer to be the only dog in the house but might get along with a large female. I would want to meet her first. I have all my vaccinations, neutered,and microchipped. I am HW negative. If you would like to fill out an application on me go to our website www.adoggie4you.org. I would really love a home of my own.

He&#039;s sweet and playful like a puppy, but mature enough to listen quite well to directions and walks nicely on leash. He loves learning new tricks and one of his specialties is giving on-demand kisses! Sebastian is the ultimate cuddle bug and promises to let you sleep in if you&#039;ll let him share your bed! He&#039;s also content to snuggle up in a comfy crate or dog bed if that&#039;s your preference. Sebastian perfected his home skills in foster where he had a doggie foster sibling, a social female pup, who slowly taught him how to dog. Now he may be able to live with a well-matched doggy sibling. He&#039;s crate-trained and was very well-behaved in the home once he understood the rules. Squeaky toys are his absolute favorite, but Sebastian also likes sturdy chew toys, food puzzles - pretty much anything he can play with he&#039;s a big fan of. This easy-going pup loves soaking up all the pets and attention from his humans and warms up quickly to new people, revealing his wiggly side once they show him some affection. Sebastian has a ton of spunk and is eager learn what tricks you have up your sleeve, especially if treats are involved! In fact, Sebastian is such a smart pup that he&#039;s part of the Total Obedience Program. The Total Obedience Program (TOP) is modeled after the AKC&#039;s Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test. As a TOP dog, he has a personalized training plan and works with a volunteer trainer several times a week to help him learn the skills to become the best dog he can be! He&#039;s learning skills like sitting calmly when approached by strangers or other dogs, staying in a sit or down until told &#039;free,&#039; and coming when called. Once Sebastian successfully complete all the skills on his training plan, he will be considered TOP Dog Ready! As a part of APA&#039;s Total Obedience Program you can work with APA staff to continue to build a training relationship with him after adoption and we can master all the TOP dog skills together. Check out a video on APA&#039;s CGC program, on which the TOP was based: https:\/\/vimeo.com\/89434193 Sebastian can&#039;t wait to find his special someone to take him home.

ABR was notified about her by a shelter volunteer who acted as her advocate, knowing what a tremendous dog she is.  She was surrendered to the shelter by a family who was moving out of state and didn&#039;t take her.  While her life with them was hardly ideal, she was initially very sad and it took some TLC to bring her out of her shell.   \n\nFoxy Boxy is now living happily with two male boxers in her foster home and eager to make friends with every human she&#039;s met.   At recent fundraising events for ABR she won lots of hearts for her sweet, calm demeanor with everyone ages 15 months to 88 years.   We were especially touched at how she bonded with some teens and young adults with developmental differences -- she was so patient and gave them the love and acceptance that they deserve.  While Boxy does not currently live with children, she did live with children in her former home and clearly misses them.  She is extremely maternal which often manifests in her wanting to lick the faces of children she meets, so any potential adopters should be aware of that in case that might be startling to their child.  In terms of other dogs, Foxy Boxy needs slow introductions to feel safe with new dogs.  ABR volunteers are happy to work with potential adopters on the best way to introduce dogs.  Boxy was wary of the dogs in her foster home for the first few hours but since then it&#039;s been nothing but domestic bliss!  Boxy does fixate on cats during walks and likely would not be ideal for a home with cats. \n\nThis lovely girl is a great choice for someone who wants the sweet loving nature of a boxer but whose life is not compatible with the needs of an active young boxer.  Perhaps that is a retired person, someone who works from home or even a family with kids who want a dog who doesn&#039;t need to be front and center.   Once she&#039;s had one short to moderate walk a day,  Foxy Boxy is happy to lounge around the house and keep watch.  She loves affection and will give as good as she gets. Her foster brothers mentored her on how to be a house pet (read: Grade A Couch Potato) and she likes lying next to them and watching the happenings of the neighborhood from the front window. Her foster mom taught her how to ring a bell at the backdoor when she needs to go outside. Her former owners had not maintained medical care but she has now been spayed and has all her shots. She tested positive for heartworms and has been on a &quot;slow kill&quot; method since coming to ABR so she might not need the traditional treatment.  ABR will work with Boxy&#039;s adopters to discern the best course of action and pay for treatment if that is what is best for her. \n\n"	"https:\/\/dl5zpyw5k3jeb.cloudfront.net\/photos\/pets\/41966393\/1\/?bust=1532963009"	"https:\/\/dl5zpyw5k3jeb.cloudfront.net\/photos\/pets\/41966393\/1\/?bust=1532963009","https:\/\/dl5zpyw5k3jeb.cloudfront.net\/photos\/pets\/41966393\/2\/?bust=1530537860","https:\/\/dl5zpyw5k3jeb.cloudfront.net\/photos\/pets\/41966393\/3\/?bust=1532963009","https:\/\/dl5zpyw5k3jeb.cloudfront.net\/photos\/pets\/41966393\/4\/?bust=1532963010"	"adoptable"	"House trained","Spay\/Neuter","Shots Current"	null	true	true	null	null	null	false	Austin Boxer Rescue	not-adopted

Migos&#039; default position is upside down, wiggling around like a goofball. He gets really excited over big plastic balls and rope toys, but also tends to make strange things his &#039;precious&#039; like stumps or rocks - he will leave them if asked, but sometimes he just has a thing for that random brick laying around. Another of Migo&#039;s standout quirks is he likes to go &#039;grass swimming,&#039; - he lays on the grass and scooches around on his belly to swim! He enjoys that almost as much as real-life belly rubs and he&#039;ll make fast friends with anyone willing to give them (He has a perfectly smooth belly so it&#039;s impossible to resist). Migos has a lot of energy to burn and likes to stay on the move. He loves his time on the trail, and then when he&#039;s all tuckered out, he becomes very snuggly with his friends. He also loves going to playgroup and enjoys playing with his canine buddies, and he may get along with a well-matched doggie sibling. A quick learner, Migos already knows &#039;sit&#039; and &#039;down&#039;, he walks well on leash and is learning a bunch of new skills in APA!&#039;s Total Obedience Program. The Total Obedience Program (TOP) is modeled after the AKC&#039;s Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test. As a TOP dog, Migos has a personalized training plan and works with a volunteer trainer several times a week to help him learn the skills to become the best dog he can be! Migos is learning skills like sitting calmly when approached by strangers or other dogs, staying in a sit or down until told &#039;free,&#039; coming when called and &#039;Place&#039;, which means he will go to a specific place in your home on command. Once Migos successfully completes all the skills on his training plan, he will be considered TOP Dog Ready! Migos is working hard to become a wonderful companion, and as a part of APA&#039;s Total Obedience Program you can work with APA staff to continue to build a training relationship with Migos after adoption and master all the TOP dog skills together. Check out a video on APA&#039;s CGC program, on which the TOP was based: https:\/\/vimeo.com\/89434193 Migos would be perfect for someone who likes to hike or run the trails and he&#039;d love a yard with some grass to swim around in (Hopefully he&#039;ll leave the bricks alone).

This feisty boy loves everyone, and if he can lay on them to take his naps, that makes his day! Tyler really loves snuggling with his people. Tyler also really wants your attention, so ignore him and he&#039;ll give a little bark to remind you that he&#039;s there and also may need a treat. When he gets excited, his ears flop around and he sticks his butt in the air. His foster mom says his facial expressions are to die for! His eyes are the color of amber and green and he makes you fall in love with him every time you make eye contact. Tyler loves playing with his large foster doggie sibling, and they&#039;re really good about sharing their toys. He has a lot of energy, but he gets it all out playing with his doggie buddy. And once he&#039;s all tuckered out, he&#039;s ready to crash and naps frequently throughout the day. You&#039;ll always know when Tyler&#039;s napping because he&#039;s quite the snorer. You&#039;ll also know because he&#039;ll probably be sleeping on top of you. Tyler is very well-mannered for a young pup and is making good progress on his house-training. His crate-training is also going well as long as toys and treats are part of the bargain, and he sleeps quietly through the night. Chill and playful all in one little baby, Tyler would make a wonderful addition to any number of loving homes, preferably one with a yard for him to run circles in and keep your kids entertained all day. Come meet this perfect pup!"

I know it is hot outside but I have a feeling Mr. Wilson would be playing in water if it was not hot.\nIf you are looking for a typical puppy with a little shyness to him then you need to meet Mr, Wilson. Give him a little time to warm up to you as he has been protected and spoiled and babied. But if you have toys and lots of toys so he can run around and try to play with all of them then Mr. Wilson is your guy. He plays gentle with his 2 sisters who are also for adoption.\nMr. Wilson&#039;s coat is medium to long, shiny and wavy and does not seem to shed, we have had him since he was 3 months old and not detected any black fur laying around. He is crate trained, sleeps in his crate with the door open.\nMr. Wilson was rescued from his pure breed black Labrador Retriever mother as she lives on the streets. He gets his smarts from her as he watches everything you do and follows you around. He is also independent and not under your feet at all times. Not a barker unless there are stranger coming, then he will run so do not expect him to protect your house, expect him to be your friend and cuddle with you.\n7 months old, quiet, playful, loves people and other dogs and cats, I think that gets him a gold star! He would be great as a companion pet or your sidekick who gazes at your with his pretty eyes. Although he is an inside dog, I hope you can provide a puppy pool for him, I swear it is his favorite toys. He runs and jumps in the pool often and when the water gets dirty, he looks at you sadly until you refill it again then he is just the happiest dog.\nADOPTION FEE &amp; APPLICATION REQUIRED\nRoxy\\&#039;s K-9 Rescue does not have a shelter, all of our dogs are raised in foster homes.

When you first look at Fridge, he might seem so stoic and serious, but when he flashes that ear-to-ear grin, your heart will melt like a scoop of ice cream on a hot summer&#039;s day! This sweet boy is the perfect dog for those of us who enjoy our quiet time. He is happy to lay right under your feet while chewing on his favorite toy, offering the quiet comfort that only dogs can provide. In the home, Fridge proved to be the perfect houseguest, potty-trained and non-destructive. Give him a squeaky toy and he&#039;ll happily trot around the house like a playful puppy. During his sleepovers, he does great on his own, with minimal barking and lots of napping! In fact, his sleepover friend described him as a &#039;lovely, easy dog.&#039; Fridge can be shy with new people at first, but when he leans in for a pet you know you&#039;ve got a friend for life. He intuitively knows exactly what his human friends need, whether it&#039;s a kiss on the cheek, a soothing lean against your leg, or playful antics that will make you laugh. Fridge is as loyal as they come and prefers to be as close to his people as possible and likes looking into their eyes as they stroke his soft velvety fur. Fridge really seems to enjoys observing his people, and human companionship (and head pets!) are his favorite things. Oh, and tennis balls. Fridge&#039;s fetch game is on point and he has an A+ in &#039;Drop&#039;. Fridge has a moderate energy level - not too lazy, not too playful. He&#039;s mastered his basic commands and is thriving in APA!&#039;s Total Obedience Program. The Total Obedience Program (TOP) is modeled after the AKC&#039;s Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test. As a TOP dog, Fridge has a personalized training plan and works with a volunteer trainer several times a week to help him learn the skills to become the best dog he can be! Fridge is learning skills like walking nicely on leash, sitting calmly when approached by strangers or other dogs, staying in a sit or down until told &#039;free,&#039; and coming when called. His greatest skill, however, is scoring bonus treats from his trainer when he flashes his trademark puppy-dog eyes. Once Fridge successfully completes all the skills on his training plan, he will be considered TOP Dog Ready! Fridge is working hard to become a wonderful companion, and as a part of APA&#039;s Total Obedience Program you can work with APA staff to continue to build a training relationship with Fridge after adoption and master all the TOP dog skills together. Check out a video on APA&#039;s CGC program, on which the TOP was based: https:\/\/vimeo.com\/89434193 Fridge is a gem of a dog and he&#039;s looking for that special person to make his own. We have no doubt he will make his forever family very happy, so if you&#039;re in need of a loyal and loving best friend, come meet Fridge today!"

But now this handsome fawn guy is headed to a healthy 70 pounds of kisses, wiggles and play bows. He even manned a kissing booth for 8 hours and never missed a kiss. Rory figured out the dog door in 5 minutes and does not fear doing his business in the rain. He has 2 foster Boxer sisters to play with or nap with and he is at ease at whatever speed the house is moving.\n\nRory is about 7 years old but has the activity and curiosity of a 5 to 6 year old. He takes his human for walks and nicely explores along the way. Rory is very dog friendly and loves his humans, and now he\u2019s discovered toys. Rory is almost completely healed from the non-contagious demodex mange he came in with, and his foster mom has him on the slow-kill method for his heartworms. He has completed the routine course of preventives for tick borne illnesses so common to the part of the valley he escaped.\n\nOf course Rory is house, crate and leash trained and just easy to live with. He seems to know he got a chance at a good life and he\u2019s going for it in a calm, loving, gentle way. His foster mom feeds her dogs and Rory a raw diet and she offers to take as much time as needed to explain it and it\u2019s benefits. Like most Boxers, Rory is very social and likes to have friends around so he would do best with a fur buddy or 2. This guy is an absolute gem; calm and confident enough to make friends and let the world come to him. \n"	"https:\/\/dl5zpyw5k3jeb.cloudfront.net\/photos\/pets\/42362256\/3\/?bust=1539779372"	"https:\/\/dl5zpyw5k3jeb.cloudfront.net\/photos\/pets\/42362256\/3\/?bust=1539779372","https:\/\/dl5zpyw5k3jeb.cloudfront.net\/photos\/pets\/42362256\/1\/?bust=1533215748","https:\/\/dl5zpyw5k3jeb.cloudfront.net\/photos\/pets\/42362256\/2\/?bust=1539779372","https:\/\/dl5zpyw5k3jeb.cloudfront.net\/photos\/pets\/42362256\/4\/?bust=1539779373"	"adoptable"	"House trained","Spay\/Neuter","Shots Current"	null	null	true	null	null	null	false	Austin Boxer Rescue	not-adopted

I will be spayed, microchipped, have all of my vaccinations, dewormed 3 times; I will be on monthly flea\/tick preventative because you know those little critters are plentiful in Texas and my foster mom makes sure we are fresh and clean all the time.\nI have a twin brother named Buster but when you look at us closely you can see the difference. I look more like my daddy and Buster has some of my mom&#039;s markings on his ears and paws, We had a sister that looked my mom but some rescue group took her before my foster mom could get back and now they won&#039;t give her back.\nSo my mom is a Basenji\/Shepherd mix and my dad is a Hound\/Shepherd mix. Dad was so sweet. Both of my parents were dumped in a bad neighborhood by their owners and they started hanging with the strays in the area that my mom feeds daily. Those strays do not want to get caught so my mom just takes care of them.\nYou can see my parents on Facebook Page: Roxy&#039;s K-9 Rescue under the album MOVING COMPANY PUPPIES.\nMy foster mom saved us from under those heavy steel beams, there were only 3 of us hanging on in the 100 degree weather. But we are happy now, we play with tennis balls that are almost bigger than us and we have BIG stuffed animals that we fight over and the toy is much bigger that both of us put together. We have a spunky survival spirit and we love being in a home. Although we miss our mom and sister.\nWe are not barkers, we are quiet and being spoiled and we love being held and carried around. When you get us, we will be spoiled rotten. They are trying to potty train us but we are resisting right now, I guess we&#039;ll give in to what they want us to do in about 2 weeks.\nI like playing with toys but I live playing with my brother Buster best of all. And when we hear our foster mom come home, she yell for joy because we know she is going to pick us up! My personality is still developing but you can say I am independent and can keep myself company playing with things.\nRight now we are at a different home and we will be going to the home of the lady who saved us and we heard she really gets puppies in shape before they go to their new home. Don&#039;t worry you will love us!!!!\nMom isn&#039;t sure if we are going to stay small since we were deprived of nutrients early in our young lives or if we&#039;ll reach the size of our parents.

He loves to try new experiences and has the most positive attitude. Polk was surrendered by his previous owners because he was kept tied up in the backyard and kept chewing through his leash. We guess it worked because now Polk is living it up at the shelter where he has human and canine friends alike and gets to go to playgroup every day. Polk loves every new person he meets and always acts like he just found his new best friend. Polk loves going on long walks, is great on leash and is very in tune with whoever&#039;s walking him. He has an exuberant play style and he thinks everything&#039;s a toy, but even if it&#039;s not, he will happily trade you for an appropriate one. A real outdoorsy pup, Polk likes getting his paws wet and sniffing all the new smells. And he&#039;s a great car passenger too - &#039;Adventure time?! Let&#039;s go!&#039; An ideal day for Polk would start with a nice hike, then back home for a romp around the yard and a game of fetch, then settling down and being brushed and eating yummy treats. As much as Polk loves to run around and have fun, he&#039;s also ready to chill with his people for a quiet night in. Polk also enjoys learning new things in APA!&#039;s Total Obedience Program. The Total Obedience Program (TOP) is modeled after the AKC&#039;s Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test. As a TOP dog, Polk has a personalized training plan and works with a volunteer trainer several times a week to help him learn the skills to become the best dog he can be! He is learning skills like sit and down, walking nicely on leash, sitting calmly when approached by strangers or other dogs, staying in a sit or down until told &#039;free,&#039; coming when called and &#039;Place&#039;, which means he\/she will go to a specific place in your home on command. Once Polk successfully completes all the skills on his training plan, he will be considered TOP Dog Ready! He is working hard to become a wonderful companion, and as a part of APA&#039;s Total Obedience Program you can work with APA staff to continue to build a training relationship with Polk after adoption and master all the TOP dog skills together. Check out a video on APA&#039;s CGC program, on which the TOP was based: https:\/\/vimeo.com\/89434193 An all around happy dude, Polk is more than ready to be a part of family that will include them in their activities and give him a nice soft bed to sleep in (He wouldn&#039;t say no to a backyard with a kiddie pool either). In return, he promises to be your best buddy in the world. Come meet this great pup!"

The poor thing has quite a story, she was stuck in the shelter for five months, through no fault of her own.  Then Lucky Lab saved her. \n\n\n\n\n\nMissy has been living in a foster home and doing very well. She\u2019s a love bug and loves, loves, loves to cuddle. She also loves the water! So if you&#039;ve got a pool or a lake, she&#039;s &quot;in!&quot; \n\n\n\n\n\nWe think having another dog in the home would be an ideal match for Missy, she really seems to blossom with another pooch around, she loves other dogs.  She is afraid of cats. \n\n\n\n\n\nMissy walks well on a leash and rides well in the car. \n\n\n\n\n\nWe&#039;d recommend a home with older kids and adults. \n\n\nMissy is shy at first and can even cower a bit when she meets new people, then she comes out of her shell. Loud voices and noises frighten her. \n\n\n\n\n\nMissy isn&#039;t a fan of going in the crate, we think it&#039;s because she was in a cage in the shelter for so long.  But once she&#039;s coaxed in with treats she does pretty well.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe is spayed, vaccinated, microchipped and housebroken.  Missy is a gem of a dog and we really want her to have an amazing home after all she&#039;s been through.  We think she&#039;s a diamond in the rough and with some love and care she will be a spunky incredible best friend! \n\n\n\n\n\nApply for Missy at www.luckylabrescue.com\n"	"https:\/\/dl5zpyw5k3jeb.cloudfront.net\/photos\/pets\/42427545\/1\/?bust=1533822584"	"https:\/\/dl5zpyw5k3jeb.cloudfront.net\/photos\/pets\/42427545\/1\/?bust=1533822584","https:\/\/dl5zpyw5k3jeb.cloudfront.net\/photos\/pets\/42427545\/2\/?bust=1533822599","https:\/\/dl5zpyw5k3jeb.cloudfront.net\/photos\/pets\/42427545\/3\/?bust=1533822608"	"adoptable"	"House trained","Spay\/Neuter","Shots Current"	null	true	true	false	null	null	false	Lucky Lab Rescue and Adoption	not-adopted

The previous owner thinks he may have been kicked by a horse, leading to his mobility issues. Outside, he walks around but does flop over and is unsteady, but loves exploring the yard and has no issues going potty by himself. Inside I have wood floors, so he doesn&#039;t have a whole lot of traction so has learned to crawl around the living room. He&#039;s great with all of the foster puppies I&#039;ve had and is really gentle with them. He loves napping on the couch while I&#039;m watching TV.

Energetic, smart and extremely playful, Manning loves rope toys and anything that bounces (the bigger the ball the better). He&#039;ll fetch but he would really prefer that you to chase him around the yard. You&#039;ll always know when it&#039;s playtime when Manning&#039;s around because you&#039;ll catch those intense blue eyes staring intently at you while he wiggles with excitement: &#039;Come chase me, human!&#039;. Manning really hates it when play time is over will wait until you&#039;re just about to grab his leash, then he&#039;ll play bow and run circles around you hoping that you&#039;ll chase him again. Manning can be a little shy with new people, but the best way to break the ice is to break out a giant ball or a rope toy. If your taste in toys is that good, Manning figures you must be okay. Manning enjoys going to playgroup and hanging out with his canine friends and should do well with a well-matched doggie sibling. He&#039;d also obviously love a yard to romp in with his favorite people. When you call his name, Manning will come right over, look up and hand you his paw.

The Total Obedience Program (TOP) is modeled after the AKC&#039;s Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test. As a TOP dog, Manning has a personalized training plan and works with a volunteer trainer several times a week to help him learn the skills to become the best dog he can be! He is learning more skills like down, walking nicely on leash, sitting calmly when approached by strangers or other dogs, staying in a sit or down until told &#039;free,&#039; coming when called and &#039;Place&#039;, which means he will go to a specific place in your home on command. Once he successfully completes all the skills on his training plan, he will be considered TOP Dog Ready! Manning is working hard to become a wonderful companion, and as a part of APA&#039;s Total Obedience Program you can work with APA staff to continue to build a training relationship with Manning after adoption and master all the TOP dog skills together. Check out a video on APA&#039;s CGC program, on which the TOP was based: https:\/\/vimeo.com\/89434193 This spirited pup will make a wonderful companion to the right family.

Saturn is basically like a big puppy, except he won&#039;t pee on the carpet or chew on your shoes. He&#039;s a great alarm clock - he wakes up every morning so happy and ready to take on the day. And he&#039;s extra cuddly in the mornings, which makes waking up that much nicer. He&#039;ll also keep you company in the bathroom and check on you in the shower to make sure you&#039;re ok. Saturn absolutely adores his people, is very affectionate with them and LOVES to cuddle. He prefers to get his ya-yas out through high energy play, so he can spend the evening curled up with you for snuggles. If you sit down, he&#039;ll crawl right into your lap and smoosh his face into your chest. He just wants to be as close to you as possible, and you&#039;ll know how relaxed he is when the snoring starts (it&#039;s loud but adorable)! Saturn has a rough and rowdy play style and generally gets along with other dogs as long as they like to play and wrestle, and he may be able to go home with a well-matched doggie sibling. He&#039;s also a total water bug and loves to play in the kiddie pool and chase water from the hose. He makes for a great trail buddy and he absolutely loves playing tug of war, but he&#039;s also happy to entertain himself with toys or sunbathe while his people are doing people things.

But he isn&#039;t pushy about asking for affection - as long as he can be nearby, Koba&#039;s one happy little camper. He can be shy with new people, but once he warms up, he becomes the most loyal and loving companion. Medium to high-energy, Koba is still a youngster and likes getting plenty of exercise. He&#039;s lived with a dog in the past and enjoys mixing it up in playgroup with his canine friends at the shelter. He&#039;s a big fan of playing tug of war and fetch (with two balls though - you&#039;ve got to trade him for the one he&#039;s got). He also has a goofy streak and likes jumping into empty bathtubs and will even help out with the yard work, breaking up all those big sticks. But Koba&#039;s not just a good time Charlie.

He&#039;ll bring it right back to you and drop the ball right in your hand. You don&#039;t have to wrestle it out of his mouth or anything. He makes an excellent trail runner\/jogging partner. He chases cats, just a little, but what full blooded dog doesn&#039;t? He loves to get pets, he loves to sniff things, he loves to wag his tail and looks adoringly at you. He barks at the mailmen and he loves to roll in the grass outside... You know, dog stuff. Eli is good with meeting new people - he will jump up on them once or twice, then proceed to rub his butt against their knees. He likes to kiss his foster mom&#039;s face when she&#039;s laying on the couch and loves a good butt scratch. He also barks if you hug someone in front of him - he gets a little jealous and wants to be included in the love. Eli loves toys, but his favorite is his ball that he will lovingly fetch and return for HOURS. He is also a talker when he plays and will make cute growly\/whiny noises waiting for you to throw the ball or tug on the other end of his rope. Overall, he has medium energy and a few hours a day of play is enough for him. Mostly, Eli just wants to be loved and accepted. He follows his foster mom around and lays next to the shower and couch or at the entrance to the kitchen. But he is definitely a major talker. He will make noises at you as if he&#039;s trying to have a conversation. His foster mom often responds just to make him feel heard. He talks at you when he wants to play, when he&#039;s hungry, when he wants out, when he wants pets, etc. But he will quiet down if you tell him &#039;hush&#039;. Eli is also very well-trained. He is house and crate-trained and knows sit, shake, come and lay down. He walks well on a leash and rarely pulls. And he has done fine with the 2 year-old staffy mix in his foster home. In fact, Eli is so well-trained, he recently became TOP Dog Ready, which means he has already learned all the skills in his training plan. The Total Obedience Program (TOP) is modeled after the AKC&#039;s Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test, and as a TOP Dog, Eli has a personalized training plan and works with a volunteer trainer several times a week to help him become the best dog he can be!

Bethany&#039;s tail is always wagging and she&#039;s great with meeting strangers. She&#039;s a very affectionate pup and will accept their love and pets for as long as they&#039;re willing to give them. In between asking for pets by sweetly sliding her head into your hands, Bethany enthusiastically and fearlessly explores any new environment. Don&#039;t be fooled by her grey whiskers, because Bethany still knows how to play like a puppy. She&#039;s very spunky and likes running around the yard to burn off energy and gets hilariously rowdy when she hops into bed for the night. Then she&#039;ll flop right down at the end of the bed to settle in for some sweet dreams. This is not the dog who will be in your face waking you up before the sun either; she&#039;s perfectly content to get up when you are. But when she does hear you get up, you&#039;ll be treated to the THUMP THUMP THUMP THUMP of her tail wagging against the bed. After a good play session or a long walk, Bethany is happy to entertain herself or just take a nap. She&#039;s not that interested in toys - when she&#039;s offered a tennis ball, she takes this as an offer to be loved on. But she does have one favorite stuffed toy she likes to chomp on and enjoys Kongs stuffed with treats. Smart and very trainable, Bethany LOVES treats, which makes working with her a breeze. She sits perfectly while she waits to be leashed up, she&#039;s 100% house-trained and has been left successfully in her crate.

I love treats and I learn very quickly. Once I get to know you, I might turn into a lap dog.

Breeze&#039;s ideal date would be a walk or run around the park, maybe a dip in the lake (she loves water), followed by relaxing with some head scratches and snuggles. When she&#039;s not burning off energy, Breeze LOVES being close to her human, resting her head on their shoulder or chest. And if you sit on the ground with her, she&#039;ll do the same thing and push you right over. There&#039;s no such thing as too close for this sweet girl. Breeze does fine meeting strangers - she&#039;s a bit aloof with new people at first, but warms up quickly, and once you have a relationship with her, she will stick by your side forever! Breeze gets along well with her doggie pals in playgroup, likes playing chase with them and has a rowdy play style that would be a good match with a doggie sibling who likes to mix it up as much as she does. She also really enjoys rope and puzzle toys to keep her mind occupied. Breeze is fully house-trained, walks well on leash, already knows &#039;sit&#039; and &#039;down&#039; and comes when you call. Smart as a whip, she&#039;s very treat-motivated, eager to please and is breezing through her training in APA!&#039;s Total Obedience Program. The Total Obedience Program (TOP) is modeled after the AKC&#039;s Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test. As a TOP dog, Breeze has a personalized training plan and works with a volunteer trainer several times a week to help her learn the skills to become the best dog she can be! Breeze is learning skills like walking nicely on leash, sitting calmly when approached by strangers or other dogs, staying in a sit or down until told &#039;free&#039; and &#039;place&#039;, which means she will go to a specific place in your home on command. Once Breeze successfully completes all the skills on her training plan, she will be considered TOP Dog Ready! Breeze is working hard to become a wonderful companion, and as a part of APA&#039;s Total Obedience Program you can work with APA staff to continue to build a training relationship with her after adoption and master all the TOP dog skills together. Check out a video on APA&#039;s CGC program, on which the TOP was based: https:\/\/vimeo.com\/89434193 Breeze would love a home with active people who will include her in their adventures and ideally a doggie playmate to help get all that energy out.

ABR always encourages slow, supervised introductions for new dogs into new settings, allowing them time to observe and learn the surroundings, hierarchy, rules and rhythms of their new home from the safety of their crate.\n\nStella is a lover with her people and will snuggle whenever possible. She loves to play and loves her walks, but like many rescued dogs, she is currently leash reactive. Consistent redirection, reassurance, and appropriate reaction (like moving to the other side of the street, retreating to a lawn so Stella can sit while the other dogs pass, offering a treat each time Stella looks to her handler rather than the other dog\u2026) will gradually help her gain confidence and trust in her handler. She does well at home with her fur friends.\n\nStella is house, crate and leash trained and sweet and loving at home. I\u2019ll add a personal note: my personal dog has been leash reactive for all of his 12 years; much less so now he\u2019s a terrific loose-leash walker.

Happiness surely is a loving, devoted, doggy pal to join you on this crazy journey we call life. Meet Tawny - the prettiest girl to walk this earth and one pooch you are going to want to have by your side. Tawny is an absolute treasure with a sweet, lovable personality. She is young at only ~ 2 years old and has a beautiful light fawn coat that sparkles. She may be Labrador Retriever mixed with something smaller like Australian Cattle Dog or terrier. She is nearly pint-sized, weighing only ~ 41lbs on a fat day.  Tawny currently lives with dogs of all sizes in her foster home and she loves them all, sometimes even climbing into a crate with her best doggy pals to take a nap. (She does seem a little too interested in the cats around her foster home to live with cats.) Because she is a proper lady, Tawny is already crate-trained, she knows how to sit on command, and she likes going for car rides. She has a very good nose and loves to sniff around to discover new things. This girl is beauty, brains, and grace all wrapped into one gorgeous package. Tawny enjoys the wide open spaces at her foster home and will run around with pure joy in her heart. You can\u2019t help but smile. But, she also enjoys couch time and won\u2019t hesitate to climb into your lap for pets and affection. Tawny\u2019s other favorite things include sleeping like a human with her head on her own pillow, laying on the floor with her legs spread out like a frog, and telling you about her day. She is a world-class dog.  Likes: friendly wrestling with other dogs, grandpas who always have the good treats, being a free spirit  Dislikes: when people forget to refill the ice tray, zombies, TV finales that are \u2018to be continued\u2026&#039;  Tawny is only $50 to adopt. Adoption includes spay, current vaccination, and microchip. Give us a call to meet her!"

His energy level is described as &#039;low low low&#039;, he doesn&#039;t need a lot of attention and has amazing manners in the home. He&#039;s fully house-trained, does just fine alone and will happily chew on his Kong in his crate while you&#039;re at work. Chico&#039;s so low key that he doesn&#039;t even bark at the doorbell, although he&#039;s always happy to see who&#039;s on the other side. He&#039;s quick to curl up next to new people, and if they come bearing treats, they have a friend for life! Chico LOVES treats and takes them very gently, and he shows people how much he loves them by giving gentle kisses. His calm and cheerful demeanor would probably make him a good companion to children as well. There&#039;s not a lot of toy playing going on with Chico, but this boy definitely likes his naps. If Chico had a favorite activity it&#039;s probably stretching out on the couch for belly rubs. He sleeps quietly through the night on his bed or the couch, and while he isn&#039;t a fan of getting up in the morning, he&#039;ll begrudgingly get up, eat some breakfast, then go back to bed. As lazy as he is most of the time, Chico is always up for taking long leisurely walks where he can stop and sniff the roses. Despite his chill demeanor, Chico is eager to please his people. This sweet guy adores home life and really just wants one that&#039;s willing to love on him and show him he&#039;s a part of the family. In return, he promises to love you forever.

She is a 5-star dog who lights up rooms with her calm, easy-going temperament. Someone surely told Sandra it was her duty in life to make people happy and she does this very well. Sandra has been EXCELLENT with kids and currently lives and does fantastic with cats and other dogs. Because she is a proper lady, she is leash-trained, house-trained, knows how to SIT on command, and is quickly learning other commands. Sandra is eager to please and has a nice, pleasant, lower energy level that will match almost any home. She would love to accompany you on an easy-going walk but is just as happy to crash with you on the sofa with some snacks (but, watch out, she may steal your spot).   Likes:  Stuffed animal toys, snoring, cuddling with her foster dad. Dislikes: Folding laundry, cold feet, pyramid schemes.  This girl is exceptional. We know there is a family or individual out there with a Sandra-shaped hole in their heart - is it yours? Sandra is only $50 to adopt. She is spayed, current on vaccinations, and microchipped.

My Foster Mommy found me on what would have been her first rescue doggie\u2019s 10th birfday. That doggie\u2019s name was Sofia, Sofi for short.  So I am the sequel or Junior to the first Sofi.  Hence the name. I even fit into to Sofi\u2019s collar. It is nice that my Foster Mommy thinks highly enough of me to name me after her bestest dog.\n\nWHERE DID YOU COME FROM?\n\nI was found in south town by a bar. I followed people if I thought they had food, I wanted some food, I was soooo hungry.  Like you know when your tummy is so mad it growls at you and you are like whoa tummy shut up, I am trying to find you some food, hush up, I am trying hard. A lady (now known as Foster Mommy) bought me a plain burger, I woulda ordered a cheese burger, but when you are beggin you can\u2019t be choosin. I got in the car with that lady.\n\nYOUR EARS ARE ADORABLE, WHAT BREED ARE YOU?\n\nFoster Mommy says my tiny ears indicated I might be part Sharpei. You can rub my ears if you want to. And my tail curls like a Chow and I am fluffy.  But this creamy off white egg shell color usually means there is some Labrador in the gene pool. I am a 43 pound, 3 year old mixed breed dog to sum it up. If you like Shiba Inus, you might find me appealing.\n\nWHAT MAKES YOU SPECIAL?\n\nHuge feet, huge appetite! And I am very sweet and attached to my Foster Mommy like glue. The only time I cause trouble and don\u2019t let my special shine is when Foster Mommy feeds us.  I have to be fed separately, because I try to steal all the other doggie\u2019s food.  Hey, I told you my appetite was HUGEEEEEE and I don\u2019t want my tummy mad at me again.\n\nWHAT DO YOU LIKE ABOUT YOUR FOSTER HOME?\n\nI like the food.  I like the other dogs. I like food. I like the cats. I like food. I like Foster Mommy. My Kong toy that I just figured out. Did I mention, I like food?\n\nDO YOU HAVE ANY SKILLS THAT HUMANS APPRECIATE?\n\nI am potty and crate trained. I do know SIT and finally learning STAY. People will appreciate my ability to follow them from room to room like a sneaky ghost. And I try hard to learn the people words, you will know this by the way I cock my head from side to side to catch your words.\n\n\nGOD&#039;S DOGS Rescue, in San Antonio TX, does not have a shelter - Our dogs are raised in foster homes in the San Antonio area.

Running, hiking, whatever he can do to keep moving, because this boy&#039;s got energy to burn. If you&#039;re looking for a fun playmate, Grayson is more than up for that, too. Grayson is really stoked that toys exist; he knows where the toy chest is and he can barely wait for you to pull one out. If he had to pick a favorite, he&#039;d probably say anything he can fetch. He will sit and wait for you to throw the ball, or if you&#039;re the one sitting, he&#039;ll drop a toy in your lap until you get the picture that it&#039;s time to throw something. He also likes to play tug of war, but if playing with his human isn&#039;t an option, he&#039;ll pick out a toy to chew on and keep himself entertained. Grayson would love an active home with a yard and a maybe family with older children who can handle his rambunctious nature. He gets really excited to see kids and seems to know they&#039;d make great playmates. If you think you can handle an adorable bundle of energy, come meet Grayson!"

They wanted his future adopters to know this  Diesel needed some time to warm up after spending almost 3 months in the shelter but he did so very quickly. We have two pups and the bond that they have created over the past month has been beautiful to watch. He is a gentle giant, a sweetheart, and will steal anyone&#039;s heart that he gets to spend enough time with. He requires some work and training but the investment you get back when you put in that time with him is indescribable. We opened our home to Diesel but now our hearts will always we be open to him as well. He loves to cuddle up with you on the couch and is perfectly happy being part of a dog pack. It will be one of the hardest decisions in our lives to bring him back after fostering him and if we had the space to keep 3 pups we would have absolutely adopted him ourselves. To the family who adopts Diesel:  Give him some time to warm up  He appreciates knowing boundaries and rules of the house  Make sure he has bones and toys to play with because eventually when he is ready it will light you up with joy to watch him play  He loves booty rubs and gives the sweetest kisses  If you give him your love, time, a warm place to sleep, and some food, you will receive love in abundance for years to come  We love Diesel and we are so heartbroken to see him leave our home but we are excited for the future adopter who will get to experience his love.  Learn more about Diesel by contacting his staff Champion at lorian.epstein@austintexas.gov. Or come down to the shelter and meet him at Austin Animal Center!"

Ok, maybe she&#039;s more of a tan than yellow, but Sadie Lynn is as mellow as they come. She has an easy-going personality and will make a wonderful companion for a like-minded couch potato or someone who works from home. Sadie Lynn gets very excited to go on walks, although she doesn&#039;t need long walks and tends to tire after a few blocks. She&#039;s also not a fan of stairs, so the less to go up and down, the better. But she definitely likes being outside and is eager to greet other people and dogs when she&#039;s out and about, her tail wagging when she sees them. While not particularly playful, all the houses around Sadie&#039;s foster home have dogs, and if all the dogs are out at once, they sing their song and run along the fence together. Other than those few bursts of excitement, Sadie Lynn prefers to sit back and relax, but she still gets excited when she sees that leash come out. Sadie Lynn has good manners in the home, she&#039;s house-trained and does well left alone. But she prefers you not do that and hang out and give her attention - she&#039;ll even gently nudge your hand if you mess up and stop petting her. She&#039;s like a little shadow and likes to be where you are, and one of her favorite places to be is laying next to your feet while you work on the computer or watch TV. And when you lay down on the couch, she&#039;ll put her head where yours is laying. She&#039;s a very sweet girl. Sadie Lynn also gets along well with the other dogs in her foster home and is so laid back that when one of her foster doggie siblings gets jealous or territorial, she pays them no mind. Sadie Lynn is ready to lounge the day away and keep you or that couch from getting too lonely. Come meet her today!"

So much so that we have to say Okay, no more kisses for now! We have timed it - he will kiss you for over 2 minutes straight if you let him. He absolutely loves to cuddle and be by your side. He loves to sleep in the bed if allowed, but is just as happy on a dog bed next to you. He loves playing with his foster siblings- who are 15 and 30 lbs less than what he his. They like to play rough. And to be honest- he takes a minute to learn to love a new dog. But once they slowly meet he becomes the submissive one in the friendship. Our 1.5 year old pup loves to pull on his collar, although we don&#039;t allow it, he just sits there and takes it. He is the sweetest dog to humans too- sometimes he gets a bit excited and nibbles, so would do best with older kids or adults, but I have never met a more loving dog. He loves walks- but also loves his sleep- a lot. He wouldn&#039;t have any issues living in an apartment. He runs in our back yard at times but usually does his business and comes back in right away. He stays in a crate while we are at work during the day with no problems. He has no food aggression at all and LOVES his chew toys- which he kindly gives up if one of our bratty dogs takes it from him. We joke about trading in our 2 dogs for him. We are only allowed 3 dogs per our HOA, and we do not want stop fostering- otherwise we would claim him as our forever pup in a heartbeat. I am jealous of his future forever family, they will have one of the greatest dogs alive.&#039;  If you think Sam is your next &#039;forever pup&#039;, email jacqueslagel@gmail.com to learn more about him!"

Her tail never seems to stop wagging with glee and her expressive face will melt your heart. You can read all her emotions just in the adorable way she perks her ears. Her gorgeous eyes truly seem to convey how much she loves you. Although she prefers to be the only animal in the house, she absolutely adores children! She is very well behaved when she&#039;s left along, and usually just occupies her time with naps or with her toys. She&#039;s also house trained and knows sit! Pebbles loves to run around the backyard, but is also up for a nice jog around the block. Walks can be a pretty entertaining endeavor as she gets a bit distracted by moving objects, specifically squirrels. She thinks they should all be her toys. She loves toys, and when she&#039;s playing that is her only focus. She has the most enthusiastic energy and really just loves to play and have fun! This sweet girl is the affection queen! She is so devoted to her people, and prefers to be as close to them as she can be. She is the best napping buddy, and loves to lay her head in your lap. She&#039;ll even let you rest your head on her if you&#039;re sleepy! Her current foster says she tries to get work done, and if Pebbles jumps up beside her it&#039;s nearly impossible to resist putting work away and snuggling. Pebbles&#039; ideal home would have a roomy backyard where she can really stretch those athletic legs. She would also love to have a family that is able to spend lots of time with her, and give her lots of attention. She is so full of love and loyalty and cannot wait to show her forever family just what an amazing companion she is. Come meet Pebbles! Her joy really is contagious!"

He likes to be as close to his person as possible, preferably laying his whole body across you to keep you warm and show you how much he loves you. He&#039;s a bit aloof when meeting new people, but seems happy to see you the next time you visit. You&#039;ll know you&#039;re in the club when he climbs up to show what a great lapdog he thinks he&#039;d make. Chill and affectionate, Kyle seems to enjoy the simple things in life - having a blast eating his meals out of a kong wobbler, taking in the great outdoors on walks around the neighborhood, and of course cuddling with his person. He may have a serious face, but he&#039;s really just a big clown, enjoying a romp around the yard to get his ya-yas out, then flopping down on top of you for some well-earned leisure time. He&#039;s been an impressive house-guest on sleepovers, quickly figuring out that he needs to potty outside and sleeping quietly through the night. This handsome guy already knows &#039;sit&#039; and is learning all kinds of new skills APA!&#039;s Total Obedience Program. The Total Obedience Program (TOP) is modeled after the AKC&#039;s Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test. As a TOP dog, Kyle has a personalized training plan and works with a volunteer trainer several times a week to help him learn the skills to become the best dog he can be! He is learning skills like sit and down, walking nicely on leash, sitting calmly when approached by strangers or other dogs, staying in a sit or down until told &#039;free,&#039; coming when called and &#039;Place&#039;, which means he will go to a specific place in your home on command. Once Kyle successfully completes all the skills on his training plan, he will be considered TOP Dog Ready! Kyle is working hard to become a wonderful companion, and as a part of APA&#039;s Total Obedience Program you can work with APA staff to continue to build a training relationship with him after adoption and master all the TOP dog skills together. Check out a video on APA&#039;s CGC program, on which the TOP was based: https:\/\/vimeo.com\/89434193 Low key but full of personality, Kyle is an easy dog to please as long as there are laps available. While he&#039;s pretty adaptable and would likely do well in an apartment, we think he&#039;d love a home with a yard to call his own. Come meet this great pup!"

Sally always stays close to her person when out and about, and if another person comes up to them, she will sit and look to her person for reassurance. Sally is calm around other dogs and people, but isn&#039;t particularly interested in interacting with them. While she can be shy when meeting new people, after some time to warm up, she&#039;ll allows pets and gently accept treats. But once she knows you, Sally becomes a very loving and loyal companion. She shares her toys with her foster mom and likes to curl up on the couch next to her. Sally really adores her soft stuffed animals, which she does not and will not destroy. She likes to carry them around gently in her mouth and will bring them all up from downstairs so she has them in one place. Sally enjoys a little fetch from time to time, but with a ball, thank you, not her babies. Sally is great on walks (unless she sees a squirrel that&#039;s up to no good) and she seems to accommodate whatever speed the human holding the leash is walking at. She has a low to medium energy level and is good with a 20 to 40 minute walk. She&#039;d also probably enjoy a secure backyard that had squirrel visitors for her to stalk. Sally does well left alone, is house and crate-trained and doesn&#039;t bark much in the house. She also has cute little ears, pretty brown eyes and comes in a nice, manageable size. If you&#039;re looking for a quiet, calm companion, you won&#039;t find a better match than Sally. Come meet her!"

But Muffin doesn&#039;t get caught up on his looks. Muffin&#039;s got things to do. You see, Muffin&#039;s one of those dogs that wants to play ALL OF THE TIME! He&#039;s so very excited to meet other playmates, and if there are other dogs around, he&#039;s gonna chase them until they play with him! Because of a learning disability, Muffin&#039;s attention is difficult to hold, and his vocabulary appears stuck at &#039;stop&#039;, &#039;no&#039; and &#039;good boy&#039;, though he recently learned &#039;sit&#039; if a treat&#039;s involved. Muffin has a lot of energy in all directions at once, and while he may not exactly have object-permanence down, he&#039;s an expert in playtime and looks for fun around every corner. Muffin&#039;s favorite toys can best be described as &#039;anything moving&#039;. He will do zoomies with the resident dog in his foster home or on his own, he enjoys tug of war with stuffed animals and playing &#039;mouth&#039; with his doggie friends. And hold onto those hollowed-out plush toys, because Muffin likes to throw them in the air and catch them. When Muffin finds a favorite plushie, he enjoys cuddling with it and occasionally grooming it. He also loves going on walks, is pretty good on leash and likes to stop a lot to look at stuff, especially if he can&#039;t figure out what it is. He&#039;s very alert to any weird sounds - if it&#039;s moving he should probably go try to play with it! When Muffin does stop moving, that means it&#039;s naptime, and he likes to lay on his human for that. He enjoys a good cuddle, but prefers sleeping separate and eats and sleeps overnight in his crate. He likes to kiss feet and hands very gently, and he&#039;s particularly fond of his foster&#039;s mother and melts into her whenever they interact. As much as he loves people, Muffin often has a difficult time focusing, as he&#039;s constantly distracted by the next bit of fun he can see and sometimes seems to be ignoring potential adopters. But out on walks, he introduces himself to everyone he walks past and has an interest in runners (he&#039;d likely make a nice jogging buddy). Overall, Muffin&#039;s entire mission in life is playing and finding ways to amuse himself. He also makes adorable &#039;gremlin noises&#039;. The ideal home for Muffin would have active people, a playful canine buddy to help burn off his energy, a yard to bound through and an unlimited supply of plushies and balls. If you&#039;re ready to be Muffin&#039;s forever playmate, come meet this great pup!"

Do you love the idea of a dog tapping his feet in excitement over a good game of fetch? Then look no further than Tom Hanks! Tom is a quiet, calm boy who just loves to spend time with people - whether it&#039;s walking the trail, playing outside, taking a dip in the water or binge watching a show, Tom is an easy guy to please. He loves the treats too and does an adorable little smack when he gets one, and he&#039;ll have you doling those out regularly just to hear it. And those jowls and slight pout are a thing of beauty. This boy wins friends quickly, and the volunteers who are lucky enough to know him have all fallen in love with him. Tom has been on sleepovers with APA volunteers where he was reported to be house-trained and extremely well-behaved in the home. He was calm and respectful while inside and gentle while playing. Tom Hanks has lots of opportunities to earn his beloved treats in APA!&#039;s Total Obedience Program (TOP), which is modeled after the AKC&#039;s Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test. As a TOP dog, Tom has a personalized training plan and works with a volunteer trainer several times a week to help him learn the skills to become the best dog he can be! He is learning skills like sit and down, walking nicely on leash, sitting calmly when approached by strangers or other dogs, staying in a sit or down until told &#039;free,&#039; coming when called and &#039;Place,&#039; which means he will go to a specific place in your home on command. Once he successfully completes all the skills on his training plan, Tom will be considered TOP Dog Ready! Tom is working hard to become a wonderful companion, and as a part of APA&#039;s Total Obedience Program you can work with APA staff to continue to build a training relationship with him after adoption and master all the TOP dog skills together. Check out a video on APA&#039;s CGC program, on which the TOP was based: https:\/\/vimeo.com\/89434193 Swing by APA today and ask to meet the handsome, sweet Tom Hanks!"

He loves attention, belly rubs, head scratches, bacon treats, you know, attention from his humans.\n\nHunk is still a hyper young Boxer boy trying to figure out how to make it all work, including his legs. He adores his humans and tries to do what they tell him to do. He is  good with other dogs but doesn\u2019t yet understand he can\u2019t swipe their food.

Clement is heartworm positive but ABR helps explain the options and helps with treatment; and treatment  does not have to be difficult now.\n\nClement probably lived on concrete before coming to ABR, and likely spent far too much time alone in a kennel. He doesn\u2019t mind going into his crate for a time, but he gets anxious and chews to calm down. When he has a fur buddy and\/or a human around he is more comfortable.

He is also a digger and will dig under a fence if not supervised.\n\nChristopher is in a small shelter in Lytle, TX and can be adopted locally or transported to your area once adopted.

The Total Obedience Program (TOP) is modeled after the AKC&#039;s Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test. As a TOP dog, Sarah has a personalized training plan and works with a volunteer trainer several times a week to help her learn the skills to become the best dog she can be! Sarah is learning skills like walking nicely on leash, sitting calmly when approached by strangers or other dogs, staying in a sit or down until told &#039;free,&#039; coming when called and &#039;Place,&#039; which means she will go to a specific place in your home on command. Once she successfully completes all the skills on her training plan, she will be considered TOP Dog Ready! She is working hard to become a wonderful companion, and as a part of APA&#039;s Total Obedience Program you can work with APA staff to continue to build a training relationship with her after adoption and master all the TOP dog skills together. Check out a video on APA&#039;s CGC program, on which the TOP was based: https:\/\/vimeo.com\/89434193 Sarah would love a home where someone is home a lot of the time and can give her a lot of attention and include her in their activities. In return, you won&#039;t find a more loyal, affectionate companion. Come meet her!"

So, rather than have a big mistake that no one wants, Captain America is looking for a new family. He\u2019s a healthy 7 year old guy in a fawn coat with a docked tail and cropped ears. He is heartworm negative. He has a gorgeous Boxer face with a white t-bone on his forehead and a white chest. And those eyes!\n\nCaptain gets along with people just fine, and he usually gets along with his fur sister unless there\u2019s something special involved like a new kid or food. He can eat by himself of course, but the kid moves around. He is house, crate and leash trained but he still has a bit too much puppy curiosity to be left to his own devices with no one home. \n\nCaptain Ameria\u2019s a typical Boxer boy who hates to get his feet wet or go out in the rain. He loves affection, attention, scratches, pets and snuggles. He needs slow introductions with other dogs, and may not choose to be friends with some. He may be most comfortable as an only dog who gets all the attention and affection and knows his role as companion and protector.\n\nCaptain America has  been in a foster home for a while as of mid March and he\u2019s doing fine. He likes to play with his human or his toys, look out the window, announce visitors and intruders, snuggle up on the couch or in bed, and take naps.

I&#039;m looking for a loving home who wants to have a loving dog to come home to or just hang out with.\nMy foster mom calls me amazing and sweet, I don&#039;t know what amazing is but I am sweet as a Hershey bar, just like chocolate and everyone loves chocolate and I am sure you will love me.\nMy foster mom thinks I&#039;m amazing because my personality and demeanor is just sweet. You see I was adopted as a puppy from a shelter. The family thought I was cute (and I am still cute) but as I grew older they didn&#039;t have time to play with me and I was very lonely and hungry. I would cry for someone to please help me.\nWell help came and I am so happy. My foster mom cries now because she can no longer keep me and fears I have to go back to the shelter. In San Antonio, Tx the shelter is a very high kill place and I will be scared to go there.\nI get along with all dogs, men and women and I love kids. I like my chewbones and I will play with them for a long time. I have never met a cat but I&#039;m so friendly I bet I could be their friend.\nI am friendly with everyone I meet. I am healthy, no longer hungry. I am spayed, microchipped and all of my vaccinations are up to date.\nCan you give me a home and a 2nd chance to love a family as my own. I will be a real good girl.\nYou can see more pictures of me on Facebook page: Roxy&#039;s K-9 Rescue\nADOPTION FEE &amp; APPLICATION REQUIRED\n\nRoxy&#039;s K-9 Rescue does not have a shelter, all of our dogs are raised in foster homes.

They are microchipped, heartworm tested and on monthly flea\/tick and heartworm preventative. ALL OF THIS IS INCLUDED IN THE ADOPTION FEE.\nMedical records will come with each dog at the time of adoption.\nOur organization is run by volunteers\/foster parents, please be patient to give us time to respond to your emails and\/or phone calls.

He is a very good listener and super food motivated so if you have a treat he will do anything for it! He is very friendly with everyone he meets. He very much enjoys his walks but not so much being outside in the yard unless it&#039;s sunny in which case he&#039;ll sunbathe for a while. He loves his squeaky toys. Is a very sound sleeper, although he prefers a people bed to a doggy bed. He needs a good amount of exercise to combat his boredom- he likes to chew things. But after his walks and a little playtime he&#039;ll go down for a nice, long nap. He loves naps. Buckbeak is the sweetest baby boy. If you love walks, cuddles and kisses he&#039;s your man. Oh and isn&#039;t he so handsome!?  Here are some notes from his short-term foster home:  He loves to be on the couch or bed and sometimes gets too comfy and doesn&#039;t realize he&#039;s on the edge. He&#039;s fallen off several pieces of furniture.  When he gets the zoomies you have to be careful if you&#039;re in his way. One time we were playing and he was chasing me but knocked me down. After he jumped over me he came back to see if I was OK and kiss my face.  When I first picked him up he immediately fell asleep.

Affectionate, low energy and low maintenance, this sweet guy loves nothing more than hanging out with his people. Described as a very caring and affectionate teddy bear, Big Caesar has a human-like look in his eyes, he&#039;s really good at knowing when you&#039;re down and is always there to give kisses to make you feel better. Big Caesar will let you love on him anyway you wish and is up for cuddles whenever you are, laying his head in your lap to ask for pets. He thinks he&#039;s a big lap dog, but he&#039;s also happy just being by your side. He loves meeting people, but doesn&#039;t get jumpy about it, though he&#039;s usually playful right away and will bring them his rope toy to play with. While he&#039;s typically relaxed and lazy, he does like to play tug of war and fetch. When he want to play, he&#039;ll bring you his rope, then lay it down next to you and wait for you to pick it up. On top of being a total sweetheart, Big Caesar is also a very well-behaved pup to have around - he doesn&#039;t take food that isn&#039;t given to him, he doesn&#039;t whine, he&#039;s fully housebroken and is great being left home for extended periods of time. He doesn&#039;t need a crate, will only chew on his toys, and he&#039;ll spend most of the day just napping on his bed until you return. And this smart guy does just about anything on command: sit, lay down, stay, roll over, shake. He even plays dead. If treats are involved, you could probably get him to drive you to the store. Big Caesar is showing off his skills and learning more in APA!&#039;s Total Obedience Program. The Total Obedience Program (TOP) is modeled after the AKC&#039;s Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test. As a TOP dog, Big Caesar has a personalized training plan and works with a volunteer trainer several times a week to help him expand his skill set to become the best dog he be! Skills such as walking nicely on leash, sitting calmly when approached by strangers or other dogs, and &#039;Place&#039;, which means he will go to a specific place in your home on command. Once he successfully completes all the skills on his training plan, Big Caesar will be considered TOP Dog Ready! He is working hard to become a wonderful companion, and as a part of APA&#039;s Total Obedience Program, you can work with APA staff to continue to build a training relationship with him after adoption and master all the TOP dog skills together. Check out a video on APA&#039;s CGC program, on which the TOP was based: https:\/\/vimeo.com\/89434193 As long as he has people to love on and a cozy bed to call is own, Big Caesar would be comfortable in any size home.

We know she has had a difficult time finding a foster parent with enough patience and compassion to help her begin to find her way. Somewhere, somehow, someone shattered her trust in humans and the outside world. She is slowly, glacially, willing to trust her foster dad and let him take her for walks, give her treats, and gently, very gently, ask her to try the outside world again. Often the unseen injuries are the deepest.\n\nVivi is a beautiful, small, brindle girl with natural ears and tail. She is heartworm negative and has finished her course of preventive medication given to all our rescues from Palm Valley. She is fully vetted, healthy and has no problem eating. She is housetrained but only goes outside to do her business. She is good on leash and loves her walks, but is immediately submissive when other people or dogs come near. She is not destructive in the house, but she is most comfortable in her crate whether she needs to be there or not.  She shows very little interest in other dogs or cats so far. \n\nShe is sweet and lovable with her foster dad now, and she did great at ABR\u2019s Austin Adoption Day in February when volunteer after volunteer came to calmly greet her. This 2 year old has made tremendous progress in her foster home and is slowly, at her own pace, learning the outside world can be welcoming and warm. Vivi has taken the first few baby steps on her journey from forgotten to family. She may never be the life of the  party or gregarious greeter, but she will surely fill someone\u2019s heart with joy as a loving, loyal, trusting companion.\n"	"https:\/\/dl5zpyw5k3jeb.cloudfront.net\/photos\/pets\/43229726\/3\/?bust=1554233032"	"https:\/\/dl5zpyw5k3jeb.cloudfront.net\/photos\/pets\/43229726\/3\/?bust=1554233032","https:\/\/dl5zpyw5k3jeb.cloudfront.net\/photos\/pets\/43229726\/1\/?bust=1541619287","https:\/\/dl5zpyw5k3jeb.cloudfront.net\/photos\/pets\/43229726\/2\/?bust=1554233032","https:\/\/dl5zpyw5k3jeb.cloudfront.net\/photos\/pets\/43229726\/4\/?bust=1554233033"	"adoptable"	"House trained","Spay\/Neuter","Shots Current"	null	null	null	null	null	null	false	Austin Boxer Rescue	not-adopted

Throwing punkins is not nice, I know they aren\u2019t really alive, but maybe they still had aspawrations to be a Jack o latern, or a pie, or a Cinderella carriage. Once you chunk that punkin, you have ended all their career options. So please next time you consider the Fall Festival activity of punkin chunkin, please think about this and the delish pie that you missed out on. Thank you, now onto the main epawsode\u2026me\u2026\n\nMy name is Punkin because I was saved right before Halloween and I am indeed the color of a pumpkin, even my eyeballs are\u2026see\u2026.*bats her eye lashes*, hence the name Punkin, because I am from Texas, and we like to say stuff different to be cool. I also have a dollop of whippy cream on my face and chest. Speaking of whippy cream, I need some sprinkled on my kibble, because I am in dire need of a weight gain.\n\nThe cutest thing about me is not my name though, it is my nubby tail.  I think someone chopped it off when I was a puppy to make me look more like a Boxer dog, but I look like a Vizsla too- I have the sleek\/athletic body of both breeds!!  I am furmiliar with walking on a leash, staying in a crate and just an all around good mid-aged dog at about 3 years of experience in being a good girl. \n\nI came from the city shelter, very skinny, like my rib cage was very noticeable. But the rescue ladies have been giving me extra yummies to help me put on the pounds, I weigh 40 lbs now, but should weigh closer to 50 and be a solid medium almost crossing to large gal.  I am currently living with other dogs, both my size and smaller and I made friends with all of them.\n\nAnd even though I am very hungry and practically starving, I take treats ever so gently from you human hand. If you want a mellow dog that will wiggle and shake it like a pumpkin flavored milk shake as soon as you get home from work, then I am the punkin for you.\n\nGOD&#039;S DOGS Rescue, in San Antonio TX, does not have a shelter - Our dogs are raised in foster homes in the San Antonio area.

(Local is in the state of Texas).

If you&#039;re looking for a the best of both worlds - a peaceful homebody and an adventurous trail buddy - this big, beautiful dog is for you! Levi&#039;s idea of the perfect date involves long walks or runs around Lady Bird Lake, where he can sniff the good scents and maybe even take a little dip in the water. Later on, he&#039;d like to jump in the car (where he&#039;s always on his best behavior) for an ice cream date and then cap it off with nice long nap on the couch. Then after he gets his second wind, Levi&#039;s ready to play fetch in the play yard and lope around like a big, goofy horse! Although he&#039;s an outdoorsy boy, Levi is a peaceful companion in the home. He&#039;s content to lay by your feet while you tap away at the computer or, better yet, snuggle up with you on the couch for some movie watching! Levi&#039;s also working on his skills with his TOP (Total Obedience Program) trainer, who is working with him on a customized training plan. So far he&#039;s proving to be a quick study, probably because he&#039;ll do anything to please his humans, especially if they have treats! The Total Obedience Program (TOP) is modeled after the AKC&#039;s Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test. As a TOP dog, Levi has a personalized training plan and works with a volunteer trainer several times a week to help him learn the skills to become the best dog he can be! Levi is learning skills like sit and down, walking nicely on leash, sitting calmly when approached by strangers or other dogs, staying in a sit or down until told &#039;free,&#039; coming when called and &#039;place&#039;, which means he will go to a specific place in your home on command. Once Levi successfully completes all the skills on his training plan, he will be considered TOP Dog Ready! Levi is working hard to become a wonderful companion, and as a part of APA&#039;s Total Obedience Program you can work with APA staff to continue to build a training relationship with him after adoption and master all the TOP dog skills together. Check out a video on APA&#039;s CGC program, on which the TOP was based: https:\/\/vimeo.com\/89434193 We should also note that Levi could potentially go home to a well-matched doggy sibling. So what do you say? Are you ready to bring home a new best friend who will stay by your side through thick and thin? Come meet Levi Strauss today and we promise you&#039;ll love him 100 times more than your most favorite pair of jeans!

This beautiful girl is a bit of a miracle child. She came to us from Animal Control paralyzed in her hind end and unable to walk. After visiting with several vets and therapists, it was said that it would be very unlikely she would walk again.\n\nShe got lots of exercise in a wheelchair to prepare her for a wonderful wheeled future. Foster mom made sure to provide extra therapy for her back legs, just to give Abigail the best chance possible. And, much to everyone&#039;s surprise, Abigail began to use her back legs. She grew stronger and stronger every day. So we did what we could to help, and we started her therapy. After several weeks of laser therapy, accupuncture, and water treadmill exercise, she was walking again!\n\nWhile she may never regain full strength and use of her legs, Abigail gets around just fine now. She stands for dinner, walks around the house, uses the dog door and ramp, and even plays fetch! She tries very hard every day to keep up physically with her furry foster sisters and brother, and usually succeeds.\n\nShe still has a special way of walking, and occasionally her legs slide right out from under her. She wears a diaper around the house because her bladder is a little weak, and sometimes she has accidents. But she doesn&#039;t let these things stop her from being a healthy, happy girl.\n\nAbigail would do wonderful in a home that is prepared to treat her as the special princess she is. She is a very high energy girl who absolutely loves toys, fetch, and &quot;deading&quot; all stuffed animals. She isn&#039;t a lap dog, and only submits to cuddles when she is dead tired. But she gives the sweetest kisses, and provides absolute joy to everyone she meets.\n\nLove dachshunds and not ready to adopt or circumstances won&#039;t permit having a dog? How about being a sponsor or making a donation. Every one of our dachshunds receives excellent medical care along with day to day food, love and housing.

He&#039;s a distinguished six year old gent.  He has character with a small bit of one ear missing and incredible coloring.  At approximately 50lbs, he could stand to indulge in some fine foods to put on a little more weight.  Like any refined gentleman, he enjoys delicacies such as jerky, chicken, bones, peanut butter....really any food.  Most of the time you can catch him enjoying a mid-day nap with his foster siblings.  He enjoys the company of other doggie chaps.  He really loves to get his daily exercise by walking and running.  He also loves bones, scratches and following his people around the house.  He would do best in a home with a fenced yard and who can walk him daily.  Bentley knows his manners and is potty trained, can use a dog door and knows the command sit.  He will occasionally bark.  Although he prefers not to go in his kennel or take a bath, he will begrudgingly oblige.  Bentley does not like rain or cats, so no outdoor living for him or kittie friends, please and thank you.  Bentley is a good dog and will make a great companion."

First let&#039;s get the most important thing out of the way, I am looking for a home where I can be a play buddy with another dog. It doesn&#039;t matter how big or what age they are because in my foster home I play with all kinds. I do not like being by myself or I get very sad, I even like to sleep with my best friend. At first I slept cuddled with my sister but she got adopted, then I became friends with another dog and he got adopted. So I had to sleep with a big Rottweiler but she didn&#039;t mind, now I have 3 little pups that I play and sleep with.\nIf you do not have a dog already looking for a companion I probably wouldn&#039;t do so good by myself. I love to play with toys all the time. I pay until I take a nap then I&#039;m back up playing again. I follow all of the rules very well in my foster home, I am house-trained and house trusted worthy. It has been months since I slept in a crate but I guess I can do it again until you get comfortable with me.\nI am happy everyday, I like to cuddle with my humans too and I&#039;ll wait until you tell me to give you a kiss.\nSo let&#039;s explain my breed, my mother was a Labrador Retriever\/Basenji Mix and my father was a Hound\/Labrador mix (I look like my dad except for the black spots on my face from my mom) There is a picture of my mom and dad so you can see how pretty they were. There are pictures of me too.\nYou can contact my foster mom for more videos and pictures and information about me. I am 5 months old and weigh 22 lbs.

I would be a great companion pup if you have another dog.\nMy special training is that I live in an apartment so I know how to run up and down the stairs, I let my foster mom know when I have to go potty but she still puts those pee pads down on the floor in case I have an accident. And I am quiet, not a barker at all.\nYou know what else is good about me? I am a soft cuddlier, I cuddle like a baby and will go to sleep in your arms. My foster mom says that I am very low maintenance whatever that means. I love my crate, it&#039;s my private home and I got in there often.\nDon&#039;t you want to meet me?

NO, not to me.\nMy foster home is an apartment and at first it was a little scary because I did not know what the stairs were. But now I run up and down the stairs for potty and walking time. I am not a barker, really the ideal apartment dog. I will let you know when I need to go out to potty and I do not bother you to go out that often. I am completely house-trained but I tell you the truth, it would be great to have some chew bones for me so I don&#039;t get bored.\nI am crate trained and I love sleeping in my crate when you go to bed but I also love being around you and quietly hanging out. I am a nosy Diva too, always trying to look out the window and so happy when my foster mom comes home from work. She has a cat and me and that cat are friends.

Next to swimming, Frank&#039;s favorite thing is going for walks and doing lots of sniffing and exploring with his volunteer friends at the shelter. Frank takes a while to warm up to new people, but once he&#039;s comfortable, that sweet and goofy personality comes out and he becomes very playful and just loads of fun to be around. He likes being close to his people (preferably in their laps), and he will rub his head affectionately on them (kinda like a cat!), and he also gives kisses. And when he gets really excited, he likes to do zoomies! Frank also has the BEST eyes. They&#039;re golden and go wonderfully with his dramatic facial expressions and adorable head tilts. Frank is also a very smart pup, and that big brain definitely thrives on physical mental stimulation. He picked up on this basic obedience skills quickly and has been a wonderful houseguest on sleepovers with volunteers: no begging for food, no getting on furniture and no accidents. And he&#039;s learning all kinds of new things in APA!&#039;s Total Obedience Program (TOP), which is modeled after the AKC&#039;s Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test. As a TOP dog, Frank has a personalized training plan and works with a volunteer trainer several times a week to help him learn the skills to become the best dog he can be! Frank is learning skills like walking nicely on leash, sitting calmly when approached by strangers or other dogs, staying in a sit or down until told &#039;free,&#039; coming when called and &#039;place&#039;, which means he will go to a specific place in your home on command. Once Frank successfully completes all the skills on his training plan, he will be considered TOP Dog Ready! Frank is working hard to become a wonderful companion, and as a part of APA&#039;s Total Obedience Program you can work with APA staff to continue to build a training relationship with him after adoption and master all the TOP dog skills together. Check out a video on APA&#039;s CGC program, on which the TOP was based: https:\/\/vimeo.com\/89434193 Fluffy, handsome, active, smart, silly and unique, Frank will make a wonderful companion to some very lucky person.

Cooke has had formal training and knows sit, down, go to bed, wait, she walks nicely on leash, and loves to train. She does have separation anxiety, so she would do best in a home without kids and where someone is always home. She does fine with other dogs, but doesn&#039;t really need them around because she loves to be the center of attention. \n\nOne important behavioral trait to note is that Cooke does have some resource guarding habits that could escalate to aggression which we have been working with in foster care, but will likely come back at first during a transition to a new home. She needs a family that will patiently continue to work with her and keep her mentally stimulated daily. \n\nShe is an adorable, fun loving dog with a lot of life and love to give.

This beautiful pup is house and crate-trained, walks well on leash and knows &#039;sit&#039;. And while he won&#039;t climb onto your furniture unless cordially invited, once he has received his invitation, he&#039;s delighted to climb up for a snuggle. Chip&#039;s polite manners don&#039;t mean he doesn&#039;t know how to cut loose and have fun. Chip loves a romp in the backyard, and he&#039;s a connoisseur of squeaky toys. He&#039;ll zoom all over the house with squeaky in mouth, and he does this adorable thing where he&#039;ll take a tennis ball from your hand in slow motion. Chip also enjoys playgroup with his canine friends at the shelter and could go home with a well-matched doggie sibling. While he can be shy with strangers, Chip loves his people and getting pets all over. He&#039;s also very intuitive, and on a recent sleepover with a volunteer, she was on the phone and raised her voice, so Chip crawled into her lap to calm her down. He definitely thinks he&#039;s a lap dog, so that&#039;s likely to happen anyway, but we&#039;re happy to give him credit for that one. Chip is in APA!&#039;s Total Obedience Program (TOP), which is modeled after the AKC&#039;s Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test. As a TOP dog, he has a personalized training plan and works with a volunteer trainer several times a week to help him learn the skills to become the best dog he can be! Chip is learning new skills like down, sitting calmly when approached by strangers or other dogs, staying in a sit or down until told &#039;free,&#039; coming when called and &#039;Place, which means he will go to a specific place in your home on command. Once he successfully completes all the skills on his training plan, Chip will be considered TOP Dog Ready! He is working hard to become a wonderful companion, and as a part of APA&#039;s Total Obedience Program you can work with APA staff to continue to build a training relationship with Chip after adoption and master all the TOP dog skills together.

As much as Amma loves hanging out with her person, she is definitely not up for being a full-time couch potato. What she is up for is whatever you want to do and is just so happy to have you with her! Amma&#039;s a very happy pup and her tail is always wagging - she wiggles and wiggles when her friends come to get her out of the kennel, and she loves getting their pets and attention. While Amma can be wary with strangers, she becomes very devoted to her people and is so eager to do what is asked of her. Once she&#039;s completed a command, she looks at you for approval and is so thrilled when you are pleased! A medium to high energy pup, Amma likes running around the yard chasing squirrels and absolutely loves to go for walks. She follows your lead to know that new things are safe, and she also just started agility training, which is helping her build her confidence. Amma&#039;s also an amazing houseguest, is very house-trained and never had an accident on extended sleepovers with volunteers. She never counter-surfs and can be left home for long hours uncrated without any issues. Amma&#039;s volunteer trainer says Amma is one of the smartest, if not the smartest, dog she&#039;s ever known, so it should come as no surprise that she&#039;s thriving in APA&#039;s Total Obedience Program, so much so that she recently became TOP Dog Ready, which means Amma has already learned all the skills in her training plan. The Total Obedience Program (TOP) is modeled after the AKC&#039;s Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test. As a TOP Dog, Amma has a personalized training plan and works with a volunteer trainer several times a week to help her learn the skills to become the best dog she can be! Dogs in the program learn skills including sit and down, walking nicely on leash, sitting calmly when approached by strangers, calmly walking past another dog, staying in a sit or down until told &#039;free,&#039; coming when called (Amma&#039;s recall is perfect) and &#039;place, which means Amma will go to a specific place in your home on command. Amma can easily generalize and find a new &#039;place&#039; very quickly (She and her trainer practice doing this on rocks outside). Amma also knows &#039;walk away&#039; for when she&#039;s too fixated on something, and she will walk away and leave it alone. And she can shake with both paws! Amma has worked hard to become a wonderful companion, and as a part of APA&#039;s Total Obedience Program you can work with APA staff to continue to build a training relationship with Amma after adoption and master all the TOP dog skills together. Check out a video on APA&#039;s CGC program, on which the TOP was based: https:\/\/vimeo.com\/89434193 Amma is looking for a home with someone who is willing to continue her training, and she&#039;d love one with a back yard for her to play in.

He&#039;s very good with other dogs and is currently living with eight ranging from an Australian Shepherd to a Yorkie. In the first couple weeks in his foster home, Otto began to recognize the family members and prefers to be in the same room as them. He enjoys having his head rubbed and getting scratches behind the ears, and is becoming more affectionate and engaged with his humans every day. He&#039;s also good with the 8 year-old he lives with and enjoys being pet by him. Otto is learning how to get around the house and enjoys strolling around the garden, stopping to smell the fresh air. A favorite spot to stop and sniff is near the chicken coop. Otto isn&#039;t crazy about crates or leashes but has responded well to being allowed to move around freely. He appears to be fully house-trained with frequent potty breaks, although he manages to make it up to eight hours through the night. He always relieves himself whenever he is let outside, so trips out are generally quite quick. Otto would love a home with easy access to the outdoors and one with people who are around quite a bit. He deserves someone to love and look after him, and in return, he promises to be an easy-going and sweet companion who won&#039;t cause any trouble.

She is a young, gorgeous heeler mix. She came to us as a stray, and we were not able to locate her owner. Fiona is a smart dog, listens well, house and leash trained. She is treat motivated and is responding well to her training. Fiona does take a moment to meet you and then she is all in. She is not as tolerant around other large dogs, but with time and patience she has been successfully introduced to small dogs in her foster home. Fiona came to us heartworm positive. She has gone through the long, painful treatment process and recovered well. All she needs now is a loving, patient home.\n\nShe is approximately 3 years old. Her adoption fee is $125. \n\nIf you would like to meet Fiona, please go to our website and complete an adoption application. We will contact you.\nwimberleywagrescue.org.

He loves tug of war and playing fetch most of all, but he&#039;s also happy to snuggle with his people when he sees its chill time. Nimbus is a huge cuddler, and every night on sleepovers, he HAS to be touching a part of his person. And if you&#039;re moving around the house, Nimbus is sure to be following like an adorable little shadow. Nimbus is a very vocal fellow, always making rumbly grumbly noises to let you know what he&#039;s feeling at all times. Usually he&#039;s feeling &#039;play time!&#039; or &#039;I love you!&#039; He has a particular fondness for underwear, so it&#039;s advisable to keep the special occasion variety off the floor. On the plus side, he can help with the laundry. We should also warn you about his eyes. They&#039;re so big and beautiful, and he makes great eye contact, so it&#039;s hard not to fall in love right away. Nimbus is working on politely meeting strangers and not seeing everyone and everything as a new toy. Even when you pet him, he thinks &#039;Oh look, your hand&#039;s a toy now!&#039; But his manners are overall pretty good. He knows sit, down, shake, and he also waits for the &#039;free command before eating. The ideal home for Nimbus would be one with an active couple or single person who will give him plenty of exercise, and he&#039;d love to have a yard to romp in. In return, he promises to love you forever. Come meet this fun pup!"

She came to us a chained dog, days after giving birth to puppies, some dying in the cold. Jane showed us day one she was a survivor. See below for more history. It is now time to find Jane her home. Jane is an amazing dog and she needs an amazing home. She is a little spoiled and is a special needs adoption, requiring more time, patience and money than the average dog. Jane is not a dog that can be left on her all day. We will be happy to answer all questions about Jane&#039;s care. Jane chooses who she likes, but a treat in hand makes a huge difference. She has been in her own space for some time now, so introducing her to another dog and new humans will be taken slowly. Maintaining her quality of life and finding her the right home is our goal. She has been recently spayed and is doing quite well. She is getting even more attention, if that is possible. Team Jane continues to care for her 24\/7 and she is greatly loved by the volunteers. If you feel Jane is a dog that you can bring into your home-life-family, please go to our website and complete an adoption application. We will contact you to set up a meet and greet. Thank you. wimberleywagrescue.org History: Jane had a Fibrocartilaginous Embolism resulting in a stroke to her spinal cord March 2017 and was paralyzed from the waist down. She improved, getting mobility in one back leg, but we had to amputate the other back leg as it was not responding to therapy and interfering with her walking. After many months of therapy, she can stand and walk a short distance using her back leg, but she can move quite fast on those three legs when she wants to. She now has a wheel chair. ORIGINAL POST - March 14, 2017 We are absolutely devastated that our beautiful Jane had a mini stroke to her spinal cord. (FCE; Fibrocartilaginous Embolism). She is paralyzed from the waist down. Prognosis is good for recovery, but it will be weeks of therapy and rehab. Jane is at CTVSH receiving the best care possible. Her condition is good. As you can imagine her care is going to be very expensive. Please help us help Jane. We urgently need donations for her care. Thank you."

She&#039;s just a wee bit shy when first meeting new people, but after a few minutes will offer them kisses (There have been only a couple exceptions to this, but the two girls she didn&#039;t give kisses to had very dark lipstick on). Low key and low energy, this sweet gal is the consummate lap dog and gets along well with her canine buddy in her foster home. She&#039;s house-trained and is great about using potty pads if you&#039;re gone for lengthy periods of time. Pixie is diabetic, but it&#039;s managed with easy-to-administer insulin shots twice a day. Pixie could thrive in a number of home situations, and as long as she has at least one human to get plenty of snuggle time with, she will be a happy little camper! Come meet this sweet pup!"

He has been a kennel dog and needs help adapting to home life, but he is almost fully housebroken and surprisingly quiet, only barking when he needs a potty break. He does very well in crates and kennels while his owner is away.  \n\nRedford bonds very quickly with his people, and is very affectionate in that goofy setter way. He does guard resources like toys, (which he LOVES to de-squeak) food and even his humans. He would be best as an only dog and in a home with no children. Because of his hunting background, Redford needs lots of outdoor active time and a securely fenced space to explore. The beauty of watching this dog cover ground is only matched by the beauty of the trust and love in his eyes as he melts onto the floor and rolls over for a belly rub.\n\nRedford is neutered, micro-chipped, up to date on vaccines, and heartworm negative. He is in a foster home in San Antonio, TX.\nFor an application to adopt or for more information about Southwest English Setter Rescue including our adoption requirements and transport availability, please go to http:\/\/www.swesr.org\/.

She absolutely adores people and will immediately dive in for snuggles. She gets so excited sometimes that she needs to burn off some energy before returning for the pets, but after some heavy playing, she is super duper cuddly and loves getting butt scritches. This spunky pup LOVES to play and will happily chase after rope toys and squeaky toys, and greeting her in her kennel is always a blast because she gets so excited to get some attention. To go with those gorgeous eyes and great smile, Jenga also has one of the best curious faces. If you point and excitedly say &#039;what&#039;s that??&#039; she will look in the direction with her eyebrows furrowed and ears perked up, and then go investigate and make sure there isn&#039;t some squirrel up to no good. Jenga loves to explore new spaces and is always on the hunt for 4-legged &#039;friends.&#039; Jenga is also always up for an adventure and very quick to learn new things. You can tell that she is always thinking, and she definitely benefits from mental stimulation. She&#039;s very treat-motivated and eager to please her person, and training and agility have been great for her. She learned &#039;shake&#039; in a matter of minutes, and after she does something well, she revels in the praise and affection from her trainer. So far, Jenga knows sit, come, place, and shake.

We were locked up at the local pound on a trumped up charge of being homeless\u2026.okay it wasn\u2019t trumped up, we were indeed actually homeless\u2026but how is that a crime??? We were shy and not good on a leash.  I litterally freeze up when leash goes on me, so I had to be carried out by my rescuer. I still have a long way to go and could benefit from more leash walking training.\n\nSince coming to rescue camp, I have made LOTS of new doggie friends and I am really really good at making friends of the furry variety, big small, young old, all of them.  On the other paw, people are not quite as scary as I thought, so I follow volunteer Theresa around the pasture and show her my belly for pats, I like that.\n\nAlso, as a secret\u2026.all us dogs call Theresa, not by her human name, we call her The HotDog Queen, she always has some in her pockets, always.

He\u2019s very energetic, funny, and a very good looking dog! As much as he likes to play, he just as much enjoys laying on the couch with you. As far as physical health goes, Braxton has it all. He loves to run, fetch, play tag (he doesn\u2019t want to be tagged, so he\u2019s VERY good at this game). Braxton is an athlete extraordinaire!  On the other hand, Braxton remains incredibly loving and gentle, and even accepting to some strangers. Not sure if this behavior is attributed to the theory that dogs only live in the \u201chere and now\u201d or if he truly has a resilient spirit, but the Shelter and his Foster Family admire him for it nonetheless. Braxton enjoys human interaction and attention.  Braxton\u2019s humor may be unintentional, but it is priceless. Some of the looks he gets on his face, especially if he\u2019s guilty of something, like drinking out of the toilet, are remarkable. Once he gets his mouth on a tennis ball, he\u2019ll often start frolicking with it, batting it around and pouncing on it like a puppy. That is his ball. It\u2019s like his security blanket. Braxton does have a preference to balls, but any other toys or ropes he can chew on, he\u2019s a happy dog. He is strong and prefers to carry a ball everywhere he goes. Everywhere.  Braxton seems to do well with other dogs. We currently have Braxton with our dog, Kodah, who is about his size, a little smaller. Braxton doesn\u2019t seem to be too bothered by another dog around. He doesn\u2019t particularly enjoy Kodah running up to him to play (Kodah LOVES to play, and it can come off a little attack-like), but Braxton just lets Kodah know he\u2019s \u201cnot in the mood\u201d and they both calm down and go about their business.   If anyone is interested in meeting Braxton, I would love to show him off!"

He is up to date on immunizations, neutered, heartworm negative, and microchipped. Tommy currently weighs 60 pounds. He is tall and lean, and a stunning black and chocolate brindle boy, with a white pattern on his chest. Tommy is a volunteer and staff favorite at Bastrop County Animal Shelter in Bastrop, TX! He is calm and sweet, and loves to be loved on. While he enjoys being outside, he really prefers lying on the couch next to his loving companion while receiving lots of pets! He is very laid back in a quiet environment. Tommy appears to be housetrained and crate trained, gets along well with small children, is dog friendly, and comes when his name is called. If he doesn&#039;t come when called initially, squat down and call his name again, and he will usually come. He has not appeared food aggressive nor does he guard toys, bones, or anything else. Tommy mostly naps during car rides. Occasionally he will try to go to the passenger front seat, but responds favorably to &quot;get in the back when told a time or two. Currently, Tommy enjoys mile long walks in the morning and at night time. He is gentle on the leash until the last few feet before returning home. I believe this is because he knows there will be several cats near the house. He is learning the command &quot;leave it in relation to cats and often responds well when on the leash. Tommy is also learning commands to &quot;sit, &quot;down, &quot;shake, &quot;roll over, &quot;beg, and &quot;speak. He is definitely treat motivated and is very smart! Tommy is a GREAT companion for someone who would like to be interactive with their dog, and he will also want to be his companion&#039;s snuggle buddy! Please contact the shelter or Terri Mueller via FB messenger or (cell) 512-332-1746 if you are interested in meeting Tommy!!!!"

My story started on the streets of Texas where I was a stray and then one day, everything changed. These days, I know what it is to be loved and cared for while making friends with every person and dog I met. I also discovered the most wonderful thing in the world- SNUGGLING!! My favorite days are filled with car rides, walks, playing with toys in the yards, and horsing around with my foster siblings. I would love to have a yard of my own and a family that is somewhat active so we could go on adventures together! My foster mom says she is blown away at how quickly I adjusted to becoming a house dog after being a stray for so long and that I am a smart boy who is eager to learn (super eager if there are treats involved!) and please. I am house trained, crate trained, and am working hard to perfect walking on my leash. I hope my new owner will understand that sometimes new things make me nervous, but I overcome that quickly with some reassurance and patience. Here is a secret though, I am super food motivated, so I would thrive with a family who will continue to teach me new things! My foster mom tells me that because I get so excited meeting new people and dogs, I\u2019d do best in a home with older children and without cats. I am up to date on my vaccines, neutered, and microchipped. I know my story is just beginning and if you think that you are my happy ending, please visit www.luckylabrescue.com to adopt me!"

Oh, I know, call Lucky Lab Rescue and Adoption! They&#039;re suckers for labs in need!&quot;  :) \n\n\n\n\n\nThe shelter said, &quot;We have some video to show you and we are praying you can save Jax. Everyone who meets him just sees the joy in his eyes and his will to live, even when he&#039;s in pain.  This is the video they sent us:\n\n\n\n\n\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/luckylabrescueadoption\/videos\/2361442240750542\/?t=6\n\n\n\n\n\nYup, we saw it and we were like, &quot;Um, holy moly! Okay, we&#039;ll give him a try.&quot;   Lucky Lab worked with a great orthopedic surgeon in Austin and Jax had surgery to help fix him up.   He&#039;s been in an amazing foster home and he is adored.  Now it&#039;s time for Jax to get his own family and keep up his rehab and grow. \n\n\n\n\n\nJax is a 1-year old, 50 lb., black lab mix.  He is a joyful and affectionate dog who enjoys playing with other dogs.  \n\n\n\n\n\nJax would do better with older children as he&#039;s still a young lab himself. He still has some of the young lab likes to chew on things phase in him but that can be worked on.   He does best crated home alone. \n\n\n\n\n\nHe is house trained, neutered and vaccinated. \n\n\n\n\n\nJax had a severe break on his right front leg and paralysis on the left front leg.  In three months, he\u2019s made an amazing start in his recovery.  He has gained full use of his right leg and full function of his left leg.  \n\n\n\n\n\nHe has some remaining loss of feeling on the left side of his left paw.  He is currently walking on his left knuckle instead of using the full paw.  He will use that paw to play and hold treats.\n\n\n\n\n\nJax needs help in the next phase of his recovery.  His right leg needs more activity to continue to stimulate bone growth around his repair.  This activity need to be on grass and soft surfaces to avoid injury to his left knuckle.  Water therapy or swimming would also be great for Jax!  As his leg is still healing, he needs to be careful to not jump down from furniture and avoid rough play with other dogs.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe is seeking a foster or foster to adopt home that can focus on increased activity for his recover.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe&#039;d love to talk to you more about Jax!

I am six months old. I weigh 13 pounds now and won&#039;t get much bigger. My max is probably 15 pounds. I sit on command, sit at door before going outside and I lay down on my bed when my foster mommy asks. I am also learning drop it and leave it because I love to pick up everything. I love all the toys they give me to play with. She is teaching me to play bite my toys and not people. Who knew they didn&#039;t like that. I give kisses now instead. I love to go out on my harness and leash. However my favorite thing to do is run and play in the backyard. I have a lot of puppy energy and I can run and run. I can fetch my ball too! She tells me inside and I run to the door and wait for her. I am doing so good on potty training. I POTTY OUTSIDE all the time now. Of course she takes me out every couple of hours right now. I bark when I know I have to go. She gets so excited when I do, gives me treats and hugs me. That is worth it!! Apparently I DON\u2019T SHED (yay) and I am super soft! My foster mom said those are great things! I love other dogs and want to play with everyone. My foster mom said there are pets called cats too but I never met one. I could be scary to small children since I am so excitable, so I need some kiddos a little older, but I do love them!! I NEED A FENCED YARD because well like I said above running is my thing. I am great cuddler too. I am CRATE TRAINED when my foster mommy can&#039;t take me to the store with her. I just take a little nap patiently waiting for her to hurry up and get home.

Yes, we know you do. Since humans stole the smellfie from us dawgs, I thought I would give this front camera human selfie thingy a try.  Nailed it. Nailed it every time.  It is an easy feat when you have the good looks of the two most desirable steeds of dawgs, the German Shepherd and the Labrador Retriever.\n\nMy ombre shaded hair fades from dark at the roots down to a creamy yellow at the bottoms.  This is natural though, I didn\u2019t go to the salon. To top off this hunk sandwich, I have what are reportedly THE cutest wittle ears ever seen on any dawg ever. But enuff about looks, I know the mostest impawtant thing about a dawg is their personality. I have that too.\n\nI am THE guy to do sofa selfies with #chillin. Or the guy to brag about how we just hiked the mountain and take a sweaty selfie\/smellfie combo. I was chosen to be rescued from the city pound because my friendly nature out friendlied every other dawg there.\n\nI weigh a great large-ish size of 50-55 pounds and at about 2 years old I won\u2019t grow much more in height, but I am hoping for some belly growth from all the chicken nuggets and sirloin steaks you will be tossing my way at those dawg friendly outdoor patio restaurants.

My offurcial name on the website is Big Bear but my Foster Parents call me Sandy for short. I am not sure how Sandy is short for Big Bear, but there isn\u2019t anything short about me, I am a Bull Mastiff blend, so I am very tall.\n\nFavorite Quote:\n\nLife is like a 93 pound bag of chocolates, you actually know what you are going to get.  Lemme explain.  I am a 7-8 year old fully grown up chocolate and caramel brindle striped dog. I am a grown up, so you will know exactly what you are getting, no crossing your fingers and your toes hoping that brand new puppy doesn\u2019t grow up to be a jerkwad.\n\nTemperament:\n\nFriendly with people of all ages, sizes, and gender. I have done well with cats too.  I can be bossy to other dogs, so your dog will not have to mind that. I want to reiterate that I am gentle with kids, even the toddley kind.  I like to be pet, and will let you touch my paws, ears, belly and booty. If you want, I will even crawl into your lap and snuggle in your pets (on the floor, I don\u2019t like to get on the furniture).\n\nExercise Sesh Level:\n\nExtra fries? Of course!\n\nExer-cise NOT extra fries:\n\nAh\u2026.I see the diffurence there. I am easy on the short walks because of my arthritis. Doing the stairs is kinda hard too due to my arthritis.  I prefer to sprawl out on the floor (not on the furniture again that dern arthritis).\n\nBehaviors:\n\nI am house trained, crate trained (need treats for encouragement), walk well on leash, and come when called. I do not jump, I suppose the arthritis has a lot to do with that.  I am working on playing nicely with other dogs, and have grown to tolerate the resident dog. I know sit, shake, and lay down.\n\nTheme Song:\n\nLean on Me! Or really\u2026. Lean on You. I am a leaner, meaning I LoVE to be next to you, sit by your side, and put my muzzle in your lap. I am hoping to find a retirement home where I will have someone to lean on for the rest of my life\n\nGOD&#039;S DOGS Rescue, in San Antonio TX, does not have a shelter - Our dogs are raised in foster homes in the San Antonio area.

Pringles likes spending as much time with his people as possible and is constantly telling them how much he loves them by giving them kisses and snuggling them. He&#039;s full of adorable playful energy and bounces with joy as he runs around with his squeaky toys. When this goofy guy lays down, he stretches out as much as possible as if he&#039;s trying to taking up the whole room. He likes playing tug of war with both other dogs and humans and throws play bows all over the place. Pringles is so loving to all the people he meets and will greet and give kisses to anyone. While he&#039;s very excited to meet strangers, he&#039;s quick to chill and snuggle once he&#039;s met their acquaintance. Pringles could go home with a well-matched doggie sibling and has done wonderfully with the 8 year-old, 20 lb, female resident dog on sleepovers with a volunteer. They played chase around the house and tug of war, and he even lets her win sometimes! He was very respectful and gentle her since she&#039;s smaller than him - she will regularly provide corrections when she does not want to play, and Pringles listens very well. Pringles is great at sleeping through the night on his dog bed, then in the morning will come get cuddles once invited on the bed. Pringles has a pretty high energy level and would likely make a great running partner, but he&#039;s always chill on sleepovers with volunteers, and after a long walk, he loves to snuggle up and just hang out. He&#039;s fully house-trained and is making progress on his crate-training, though he&#039;s had the most success being left home with a canine friend to keep him company. Pringles walks pretty well on leash and always responds quickly when asked for a &#039;sit&#039; or &#039;down&#039;.

He is the perfect companion.\u00a0His favorite thing is going on walks; he will walk right beside you without pulling on the leash. He will roll over at anytime for a belly rub. If you like cuddling, he will snuggle in bed with you, but will also sleep on the floor or a dog bed. This fast guy loves to play chase with balls, and enjoys riding in the car and sticking his head outside of the window to feel the air.\u00a0He also loves to be indoors. He\u2019s strong, but will gently take treats.\n\nThis smart guy is bilingual \u2014 he understands Spanish and English commands. He\u2019s good with larger dogs. For the past 2 1\/2 months, he has been fostered with two GSDs and one Chow, with no incidents from him. He does not care for cats or really small dogs. If he\u2019s walking on leash he won\u2019t pull towards them, but in his own yard he will chase them.\n\nDelgado would make a great addition to a family with someone who will walk and play with him \u2014 but mostly who will give him love.\u00a0 Please fill out the application if you are that family! \n\nLink to Application:\nhttp:\/\/www.gsdrescuectx.com\/adoption-application.html\n\n"	"https:\/\/dl5zpyw5k3jeb.cloudfront.net\/photos\/pets\/43916388\/1\/?bust=1549054009"	"https:\/\/dl5zpyw5k3jeb.cloudfront.net\/photos\/pets\/43916388\/1\/?bust=1549054009","https:\/\/dl5zpyw5k3jeb.cloudfront.net\/photos\/pets\/43916388\/2\/?bust=1549054035"	"adoptable"	"House trained","Spay\/Neuter","Shots Current"	null	null	null	false	null	null	false	German Shepherd Rescue Central Texas	not-adopted

Chuck is a classy, calm, well-mannered gentlemen with his trademark pointed ears, model-like dimples, and scrunched face, he makes heads turn with these stunning characteristics. As if those wrinkles didn&#039;t distinguish him enough, he makes the cutest strange little noises to help let you know just what he&#039;s thinking rather than barking. Chuck is very observant of his surroundings and loves to watch the world go by without displaying any reactive behavior. We did not test him with another canine companion but could imagine his low-key demeanor would carry over in those situations but would recommend a meet-and-greet as with any addition to a new squad. He would make for an excellent apartment roommate to a human given there are skyline views or a nice porch to roam. Chuck can be your well-behaved restaurant patio companion for happy hour drinks or Taco Tuesdays as long as you&#039;re willing to share because he LOVES tacos but not so much P Terry&#039;s french fries (I told you he was unique, right?!). On weekends, he&#039;s down to get a bit adventurous and stick his toes in the waters of the Greenbelt and catch a tan sunbathing by Lady Bird Lake. Chuck is still getting used to the idea of someone leading him thru life instead of roaming the streets alone so he takes a bit of time to gain trust and will need a confident owner willing to help him build up his own. He may not walk perfectly on a leash just yet but he will not pull and can be trusted. If you&#039;re able to provide Chuck with an urban lifestyle he so greatly deserves, he&#039;ll reward you with the luxury of loyal companionship for life.

Mostly mellow but with a bit of active side, Fred walks well on leash - unless he sees another dog, at which point he really wants to go say hi and starts breaking into play bows. We think he&#039;d love another playful dog to romp around with, but he&#039;s pretty chill otherwise. Fred can be shy with new men coming into the home, but out and about he&#039;s fine with everybody petting him. Fred does great when left home alone and is happy to sleep on the couch until you return. He&#039;s not a big fan of the crate, but he&#039;ll go in after a treat and settles down just fine. He sleeps in his crate through the night, and when you wake him up in the morning, he gives you his belly so he can get some belly rubs in before starting the day. Although he&#039;s house-trained, Fred doesn&#039;t seem to have much training otherwise, though he does know the word &#039;no&#039; and will bow his head as soon as you say it. He doesn&#039;t bark very often unless he needs to let you know something about the outside world.

She has been examined by a vet and it appears this is from an old injury. Annie loves to go on long walks, trotting along at a reasonable pace, she walks well on a leash. Annie and her foster take walks with a friend who has a terrier mix and a lab. Once Annie greets the other dogs, she ignores them during the walk. She gets along with most of the neighborhood dogs. She has not had an opportunity to meet any cats. Annie warms up quickly to adults. We haven&#039;t had a chance to introduce her to children yet but we will update this as soon as we do. She loves to play inside in short spurts, bouncing around, giving kisses, flipping over onto her back, wiggling around just having fun. Annie sleeps in her crate with the door open, she does not like to be shut in. She does well when left alone.

I am mild mannered for my age, accept treats ever so gently and already have some leash skills. Plus I know how to do a SIT.\n\nI am labeled as a German Shepherd mix because of my black saddle and tan undermarkings, but this black and yellow combo often comes from Labrador genes as well. I have the blocky head and draped ears of a Lab. I am 1-2 years old and 50 pounds of handsome sauce. The volunteer lady said my fur is ultra soft and you will want to snuggle me.\n\nI am a young guy and would be ideal for outings to go explore the great outdoors and then take it easy later in the great indoors.

Who let the pointy eared cutie in the Lab rescue? :) This is Sebastian and he&#039;s great.  He can be adopted in Texas and New England. \n\n\n\n\n\nSebastian is estimated to be about 2 years old but he doesn&#039;t seem to know it. He has a lot of positive energy and loves to play. He likes toys and bones and running REALLY fast! \n\n\n\n\n\nHe gets along great with people and other dogs but we not sure about cats. \n\n\n\n\n\nSebastian gets so excited to see you he still jumps a bit-- and needs a little work in that department. For that reason we would want to avoid a home with very small children, we&#039;d recommend older kids. \n\n\n\n\n\nSebastian doesn&#039;t care to share his food unless he&#039;s already eaten and no longer hungry. He typically eats in his crate and goes in without a fuss. If you will allow him on the couch or your bed, he will be the best snuggler ever! Sebastian has a lot of love to give! Just look at the heart on his nose.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe weighs about 43 lbs.

Once Bebop successfully completes all the skills on his training plan, he will be considered TOP Dog Ready! Bebop is working hard to become a wonderful companion, and as a part of APA&#039;s Total Obedience Program you can work with APA staff to continue to build a training relationship with him after adoption and master all the TOP dog skills together.

But she&#039;s definitely up for napping anytime of the day and will try to nest in any spot that looks remotely soft, whether that be a pillow, a blanket or the laundry. Fideo doesn&#039;t demand a lot of attention, but expects it when she seeks it out. She will climb in your lap for pets and nudge you with her head to let you know you&#039;re not done. She&#039;s pretty independent and likes to be in the same room as you and sometimes nap next to you or on your lap. She seems curious with strangers, though she doesn&#039;t want any new person to touch her until she knows they&#039;re cool. But once she warms up, she&#039;ll greet you when you come home with a rapidly wagging tail and her adorable snaggle tooth smile. And she gives kisses! Fideo naps when left home alone and stays in an xpen with a puppy pad. She did figure out how to get out of the xpen on the first day (she just needed to scoot it over three feet and then she was out!), but she was well behaved for her few hours of freedom. She sleeps quietly through the night, is house-trained, hasn&#039;t shown any destructive behaviors and doesn&#039;t whine. Fideo goes on &#039;walks&#039; in the backyard, and while she doesn&#039;t seem to know any commands, she&#039;s great on leash and loves exploring the yard. She also likes to sweep the kitchen floor for crumbs. Fideo has lived with multiple dogs in the past and should do well with smaller or older pups. She hasn&#039;t lived with cats but totally ignores the neighbors cat when he is hanging out in the yard. Laid back, smart and independent, Fideo is a low maintenance lady who&#039;s just looking for a home that&#039;s as chill as she is. Come meet her!"

He gets along well with his other foster siblings. CTDR is not sure of Bentleys complete background. It seems he was rescued and put in boarding last year and after a few weeks the boarding facility could not reach his rescue contact. It seems he was abandoned again at boarding. This facility continued to care for Bentley and could not bring themselves to surrender him to the city shelter. They believed he would not survive. You see, Bentley is \u201cBlind\u201d. There is no obvious cause like Glaucoma, cataracts or trauma. After a few more weeks of non contact from Bentley\u2019s rescue CTDR was contacted. As is usual CTDR stepped up. Bentley was vetted and tested negative for heartworms. He is now living comfortably (Except for diet) in his foster home. But he would like his own \u201cForever Home\u201d. Bentley is a low energy boy, who is happy being loved on by his people and exploring his surrounding like most dachshunds. He does bump into things a little more often than others, but that does not slow him down any. Bentley has been good both in his kennel and about going outside to do his business.

She loves to cuddle and will climb up on your lap if you let her.  She is very treat-oriented, great for training! \n\n\nHer foster parents have already (nearly) trained her to wait by her dinner when told \u201csit\u201d and \u201cstay.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\nShe is gentle, but has a habit of using her mouth when playing.  Her foster parents have worked to break her of that habit, but occasionally it still comes out.\n\n\n\n\n\nIvy also has a great sense of curiosity and is obviously an intelligent dog.  She\u2019s a \u201cprairie dogger,\u201d standing on her hind legs to see what is in someone\u2019s hands or on a table or counter.  Even though she sniffs, she has never taken any food she hasn\u2019t been explicitly given.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf allowed, Ivy would be a stereotypical squirrel and car chaser, and is super interested in her foster parents\u2019 cat.  Although she is not hostile to the cat, she would chase it if she could.  With time and an no-nonsense, stand-your-ground cat, she would learn to tolerate one. But every cat is different, so we can&#039;t guarantee purrrrfect placement. \n\n\n\n\n\nWe think Ivy was kept alone and outside before she came to Lucky Lab Rescue.  She barks and growls at other dogs when on a leash, but has had good interactions at the dog park.  \n\n\nShe needs more socialization with dogs and would thrive in a home with a bigger, older dog who would be who can show her the ropes. We can arrange a meet and greet for her if an adopter currently owns a dog. \n\n\n\n\n\nShe is spayed, vaccinated, microchipped and housebroken.

I would rather be known for my great manners and mastery at chasing cats but never actually attacking them, now that takes will power. I am a 1 year old, purebred St. Bernard at about 105lbs and a little underweight still.\n\nI am great around many other large dogs, like a Lassie dog and an Irish Wolf Hound, it is like a story book of heroic giants around here.

My mutto is \u201calways hope for the park, even if you know it will be the Vet.\u201d Gotta have faith.\n\nMy social skills do need a bit of brushing up, almost as much as my rugged coat. I was found abandoned on a deer lease near Mexico. They are not sure of my history, but they think I was an outside dog mostly, because I prefer to be outside.  Note to self: ask me that question again in the 100 degree summer, but for right now in winter, outdoors are cool.\n\nI am not well socialized in the city and seem to enjoy being a country bumpkin. Gun shots don\u2019t phase me, but city sounds make be wary.  I will need a home that understands my personal space boundaries. I LOVE attention and rubs, but I get a little nervous if you grab my tail or squish my face.  I do give a warning growl when you have entered the NO RUB ZONES, so I am okay with kids that understand the NO RUB ZONES.  I do not like people who think they can rub all over me willy nilly like I am a bottle of coconut oil, so for best results, no young children or toddlers would be ideal and safest bet.\n\nI am looking for a home that is well suited for a large fluffy young dog and will manage my idiosyncrasies, like boundaries and no rub zones. I really am hoping for a country cottage over a city condo and hope to have a BIG yard to romp in, hopefully with another large dog to pal around with.

Apollo will happily get in your spot to keep it warm if you want him to. Apollo is also a big believer that everyone should carry a toy or bone with them. Don&#039;t have a toy to carry? No worries! He will run to grab a toy returning joyfully to you to say welcome home. He wouldn&#039;t mind having a doggie brother or sister either. Come meet Apollo and discover for yourself what a wonderful companion he is.    Reach out to his foster family at dogfoster512@gmail.com to set up a meeting and see if you could be his forever family!"

And those big, puppy-dog eyes only make you fall in love with her further. Her foster mom lovingly calls her Snugglebug because she insists on getting as close to you as she can. Lovebug can be shy when meeting new people, but she warms up quickly and then will try to climb into your lap any chance she gets (even when you&#039;re standing!). She loves to be the center of attention, and she will let you know with a nose boop if she feels like you aren&#039;t giving her all of the attention she deserves. And if she falls asleep on her back, be ready to hear her snore! She also has very expressive ears, and they always let you how she is feeling. Now that she&#039;s feeling better, Lovebug likes to run and jump around, enjoys playing with stuffed animals and tug of war is her favorite game. For a two-year-old, Lovebug has already had a rough go at life. When she began experiencing hair loss, her previous family took her to a vet to get treated. Only a week after she was put on medication, the family surrendered her to their local shelter. A rescue partner of APA! reached out to us in an attempt to save Lovebug&#039;s life, and there were no questions asked. We scooped her up and delivered her into the arms of her current foster mom. Once Lovebug was in APA!&#039;s care, the APA! Medical Triage &amp; Wellness Clinic was able to determine that Lovebug was suffering from Demodex mange, which is the most common form of mange and is not contagious to other pets or to humans. Lovebug&#039;s fur is finally coming back in and she&#039;s more than ready to find her forever home. At 2 years-old, Lovebug still has a very puppyish personality, but she has excellent manners in the home - she&#039;s house-trained and does well being crated or left out to roam free while left home alone without any destructive tendencies. And she&#039;s done well with the small dogs she lives with. She&#039;s a goofy, kind and all around amazing young lady, and she can&#039;t wait to cuddle with you! Come meet this perfect pup!"

His eyes are so pretty, we swear he must be sneaking on some eyeliner when nobody&#039;s looking. He has one adorably expressive ear and one stoic one, and between the two of them, you can always tell what Benito&#039;s thinking. And when he needs something, he gently paws at your knee to let you know. Benito has a real zest for life and loves to go on long walks and hikes and would likely make a great running partner. Benito also LOVES to play and tennis balls and rope toys are his favorite things. He loves to play fetch and even tosses the ball around for himself and has a collection of toys in his foster home that he&#039;s great at keeping himself entertained with. Benito does get pretty amped up during playtime, but once he gets it out of his system, he&#039;s relaxed and chill and happy to be a couch potato. As energetic as he is, Benito is the sweetest snuggler and likes to drape himself over your chest and snore softly. Benito learns commands very quickly and clearly wants to please his person. He&#039;s a very intuitive pup and seems to understand what&#039;s expected of him and obliges. If you want him to stop doing something, all you have to do is tell him and he instantly stops. He&#039;s ready to play when you feel like playing and stops on a dime when it&#039;s time to chill and lays his head in your lap. Benito wasn&#039;t crazy about kennel life and took it out on his bed and toys, but since spending time in his current foster home, he hasn&#039;t exhibited any of that destructive behavior. He&#039;s a completely different dog out of shelter and has transformed into a happy little mush-ball. He&#039;s fully house and crate-trained and goes into his crate easily and never makes a peep. Benito is friendly with meeting new people and may also do well with a doggie sibling that shares his rough and rowdy play style. He already knows &#039;sit&#039;, is working on &#039;drop&#039; and learning all kinds of skills in APA!&#039;s Total Obedience Program. The Total Obedience Program (TOP) is modeled after the AKC&#039;s Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test. As a TOP dog, Benito has a personalized training plan and works with a volunteer trainer several times a week to help him learn the skills to become the best dog he can be! Benito is learning skills like sit and down, walking nicely on leash, sitting calmly when approached by strangers or other dogs, staying in a sit or down until told &#039;free,&#039; coming when called and &#039;Place&#039;, which means he will go to a specific place in your home on command. Once Benito successfully completes all the skills on his training plan, he will be considered TOP Dog Ready! Benito is working hard to become a wonderful companion, and as a part of APA&#039;s Total Obedience Program you can work with APA staff to continue to build a training relationship with Benito after adoption and master all the TOP dog skills together. Check out a video on APA&#039;s CGC program, on which the TOP was based: https:\/\/vimeo.com\/89434193 Benito would love to become part of an active household that will play with him to his heart&#039;s content. In return, he&#039;ll love you forever. Come meet this sweet pup!"

I\u2019m just over a year old and some sort of mixed-breed wire haired terrier, full of intelligence and fun. I weigh about 23 pounds soaking wet. Back in October of 2018 I got hit by a car out on 812 and was rescued and taken to the vet where my x-rays revealed no broken bones, just a bruised and cut noggin. \n\nA couple weeks later after I healed, I got all my rabies and parvo shots, and heart worm and flea preventatives. I have been spayed and don\u2019t have any health issues or allergies, and I even chew my food like a lady!\n\nPet strangers don\u2019t bother me, I just have to be introduced first. People strangers take a little more of an introduction, but once I know they\u2019re not going to hurt me or my pack, I settle down and do just fine with them. If I can\u2019t meet them, I just get anxious and won\u2019t stop barking and growling because I want my pack to be safe!\n\nBeing a terrier, I am full of energy. When I\u2019m bored, there\u2019s nothing I like better than to chew on a good bone or treat ball (and the occasional shoe when I can\u2019t find one of those). Outside is my favorite place to be. I need strenuous play for at least an hour every day, but I\u2019d really like about double that. I get up early in the morning, usually around 6:00 AM and I\u2019m ready to play right after I do my morning business. I love running, chasing flags, chasing balls, chasing other dogs, basically chasing anything because I LOVE to run and jump. I\u2019m still trying to figure out how to play catch-the-frizbee, but in consolation I\u2019ll let you know I\u2019m really good at tackle-the-frizbee. \n\nSecond only to playing, my favorite thing to do is sniff around while I wait for the humans to give me a job. They don\u2019t know it yet, but I\u2019d be great at a job where I could sniff around and pick things up and carry them. I bet I\u2019d be great at a lot more than that, like learning tricks, but I do those things naturally. All I need is somebody who can give me the time to train me because my brain is always whirring and I just want to be working! I\u2019ve started learning some commands like sit and stay so I know there is so much more I can learn and do. I\u2019m just so excited to be alive and I want a human who can do as much for me as I\u2019m going to do for him or her. \nApply Here: www.bastropanimalrescue.orgInterested in adopting a pet from Bastrop Animal Rescue?

And there are plenty of opportunities for Juanita to smile and flash those pretty eyes because she&#039;s a party girl with lots and lots of energy to burn. Juanita loves rope toys and giving smooches to her humans and should make the perfect running partner for the trail. This smart pup is also thriving in APA!&#039;s Total Obedience Program (TOP), which is modeled after the AKC&#039;s Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test. As a TOP dog, Juanita has a personalized training plan and works with a volunteer trainer several times a week to help her learn the skills to become the best dog she can be! She is learning skills like sit and down, walking nicely on leash, sitting calmly when approached by strangers or other dogs, staying in a sit or down until told &#039;free,&#039; coming when called and &#039;place&#039;, which means she will go to a specific place in your home on command. Once she successfully completes all the skills on her training plan, Juanita will be considered TOP Dog Ready! Juanita is working hard to become a wonderful companion, and as a part of APA&#039;s Total Obedience Program you can work with APA staff to continue to build a training relationship with her after adoption and master all the TOP dog skills together.

Of if you are real sciencey and a chemistry buff, you can pretend I was named after the abbreviation for oxides of sulfur. But if that were the case, I would want to be named after my 3 favorite elements Barium (Ba), Cobalt (Co) and Nitrogen (N), because their acronyms spell BACON!!!\n\nScience lesson over and more about me.  I am a BOY pair of socks, and that is the only pair I have left as per the neutering surgery. At 4 months old, I am full of puppy power, playfulness and kisses. I am a brindle and white Terrier mix and only weigh about 20 pounds right now and might only reach the low end of size medium.\n\nMy goofy ears periodically decide to go in diffurent directions, so if you need directions on how to get to the park, don\u2019t ask me, it will be like asking the Scarecrow on wizard of oz and you might not get where you are going. I get where I am going by running and galloping.  I mostly go towards my friends, so that I can play wrastle mania.\n\nI have lots of furry friends and sleep with a bunch of bunkmates. I do have some human friends too.  But I should tell you that I mostly like medium size and tall people.  Short people like kids make me nervous.\n\nI am not sure about hobbits though, they are short but adults, so maybe I would like them???? To be on the safe side, Bilbo Baggins, do not apply for me, okay? I am ready to learn potty skills and I already know about walking on a leash.

I had another visit with the dogtor and had an ultrasound and biopsy. The results came back fairly positive. I do not have any cancerous cells, but the ultrasound did reveal some abnormalities in my liver and gall bladder. My liver is slightly swollen and gall bladder is retaining some sludge. Dogtor is not positive if the liver is causing the gall bladder problems or vice versa. I am now on medication for both and will go back to the vet in a month for another bile acid test to see if we have concurred my issues.I am definitely on the mend and really settling in with foster mom and dad. \nI had my first grooming on Thursday, and boy am I cute! If I don&#039;t say so myself. I was on my best behavior as my stylist made me look so pretty. I am looking forward to meeting a new family that wants to love and take care of me for the rest of my days. I have so much love to give!\nAnxiously awaiting your application to adopt,\nJersey \n2\/23\/19 - Update\nHey everyone, Jersey here. I wanted to give you an update on my progress with foster mom and dad and my recent visits to the dogtor. I have decided that foster mom and dad are pretty fun. Foster dad brings me to work with him almost every day, so I am getting more comfortable in the car and love getting to spend the day with a lot of loving folks. I have been sharing my new home with a foster brother, Pepe the chihuahua, who seems to not mind my presence at all. We don&#039;t play, as I am still a little under the weather. I have definitely begun to show my personality more and have a little zip in my step now. I sleep so well through the night and have shown foster mom and dad that I am 100% potty trained. I have been to the vet a few times to try to figure out what is causing my awkward gait, and am getting closer to a diagnosis and treatment plan. The focus has been on my liver function, because some tests have pointed in that direction. It was confirmed this week that there is definitely something going on and I am scheduled for another test March 11th. I am hopeful that this test will pinpoint my illness and I can begin the road to recovery. I am a super loving pup that just wants to share my life with a super loving family. More updates to come after my next round of testing.\nHowdy folks! My name is Jersey, but don\u2019t let it fool you. I am not a northern girl, as I am proud to be a Texan. I am almost 9 years old and just under 8 pounds of lovable, sweet, Yorkie. I was recently surrendered to UYR by a savior that has tried to help me several times over my life. She wanted to provide a great home for me, but other puppies in the house occupied the only spaces her home would allow. So she did the next best thing and put me with new foster mom and dad. I have been here a week and am really settling in. I am a perfect southern young lady that is completely housebroken, a great snuggle buddy, loves other dogs, and sleeps through the night. I don\u2019t bark at much and really love my two meals a day. I even like to observe things being cooked in the kitchen by foster mom and dad. I am not very fond of riding in the car or baths, but I will tolerate them.\n\nI have been to the dogtor a few times last week to try to narrow down an issue I am having with my gait. I am fairly slow to get around, can appear a little dizzy at times,  and really can\u2019t navigate any steps to and from the house. I also suffer from dry eye syndrome, but have medication that I have been taking for years  twice a day that keeps that in check. Dogtor has scheduled another test for me this week to get a better understanding of what is going on. Updates will follow.\n\nI am looking for a forever home with a mom and dad that have a lot of time for me. I love to be on the couch with them, but need help getting up and down. Ideally my new parents will not have small children due to my size and lack of quick reflexes. I have a Texas size amount of love to give and want so badly to share that with my new parents."

When no one else at the ranch paid him much attention, Huey went wandering. For 4 months, he wandered a country neighborhood alone, following families on their walks with their dogs and playing with dogs along their fence lines, but was unwilling to let anyone catch him. He just didn&#039;t trust humans enough to let them come close.\n He spent both excruciatingly hot and freezing cold days laying out in the elements, in plain sight, but uncatchable. Animal control tried for 3 months. Neighbors tried to entice him into yards. The kind neighbors kept him fed, but he still wouldn&#039;t trust anyone. \nFinally a trapper stepped in and set a trap for him. A couple of days later, while checking the trap, the trapper was startled to look up and see him watching her. She watched him as he ambled by the trap location and down the street. She followed from a distance and found he had wandered into a neighbors fenced yard to play with her dog. A closed gate, snare, a can of vienna sausage snacks and an hour later, and he was on his way to a new life. \nAt first, he flinched when touched, having forgotten the sensation. But with time and love he has tuned into a big, lovable baby who adores attention. He has no concept of his size and would prefer to be a lap dog. He is fairly low energy and is happy napping on the couch or outside in the sun. He walks well on a leash, but has a bit of fear about getting into the car that he is working on. He enjoys a hike at the park and a big yard to hang out in, but doesn&#039;t need a lot of high energy exercise to be happy. \nHe is such a tall boy that he is a terrible counter surfer...he pretty much thinks that if it&#039;s close to the counter edge, you put it there for him. He loves toys, but mostly just carrying them around and trying to bury them in the yard. \nHe enjoys other dogs, especially smaller ones. He might take a bit of an adjustment period with other large dogs, but he has become friends with every dog he has met eventually. \nHe mostly sleeps on a dog bed, but once in awhile climbs up into bed to cuddle. He will chew on things you leave on the floor if you&#039;re not careful, but he&#039;s not a destructive chewer generally and does well left out at home unsupervised. \nHe is not a fan of a kennel, but can be kenneled if necessary. \nHuey just needs love and a lifetime supply of dog chow to be happy. He&#039;ll even give you the biggest butt wiggles you have ever seen when you walk through the door. What more could a human ask for?"

This poor pup came from a neglectful and abusive past, so we are searching for just the right family as his fur-ever home. While initially cautious towards strangers, Red adores his people. However, he can be fearful of men due to his previous experiences. He has never shown any aggressiveness and is always eager to please, so it doesn&#039;t take much to show this pup what you&#039;d like for him to do. Gently corrections are the way to go with Red and his high food-motivation makes training much easier. He LOVES his kennel and you&#039;ll usually find him lounging in it with a squeaky toy or two (or all of them). Speaking of toys, Red has some resource guard issues, so gentle and patient correction is needed to show him he doesn&#039;t need to worry about his toys being taken. He also has a habit of sometimes taking other dog&#039;s food, so it would be best for him to be watched if he&#039;s fed with another dog or just fed separately. Red does wonderfully on a leash and greets other dogs and people in a friendly manner. He may do well in a home with one other dog, but slow and supervised intros are a must! While Red loves the company of his people, he doesn&#039;t seem to really care for playtime, as he&#039;d rather just sit and contentedly chew on his squeaky toy next to you. While he may get along with other dogs and adults, he would do best in a home without other non-canine pets and children under the age of 10. Dog-savvy older children are welcome, as he will need lots of love, patience, and proper guidance from the whole family to help him flourish into the pup he was always meant to be.

He loves giving hugs to his new human friends and seems to adore everyone he meets. It&#039;s not long before he&#039;s rolled over on his back looking for belly-rubs and then jumping up to show off his adorable zoomies. This playful guy loves to play catch and tug of war, and as much as Alexander loves toys, if there aren&#039;t any around, he&#039;ll entertain himself running around holding his own leash. While he&#039;s full of energy during playtime, Alexander is also well-mannered and knows when to chill out and settle for some cuddle time. It&#039;s times like these where he just seems to radiate calmness, sometimes finding a nice sunbeam to lay in and take a long siesta. At night Alexander loves to sleep with you or on his own bed where you&#039;ll be treated to his adorable (but soft) snoring. That&#039;s until you show him a toy - then he&#039;s up and ready to party! Alexander loves going for rides in the car and, very adorably, in a golf cart. He&#039;s also quite the waterbug and loves to run and splash in the water on a hot Summer day. We love how happy Alexander looks even when he&#039;s just rolling around on the grass to scratch his back or holding up his favorite toy between his paws to better admire it. Alexander has proven to be the perfect example of man&#039;s best friend in his foster home, and he recently became TOP Dog Ready! This means he has already learned all the skills in APA!&#039;s Total Obedience Program (TOP), which is modeled after the AKC&#039;s Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test. Dogs in the program learn skills including sit and down, walking nicely on a leash, sitting calmly when approached by strangers, calmly walking past another dog, staying in sit or down until told &#039;free&#039;, coming when called and &#039;place&#039; which means Alexander will go to a specific place in your home on command. Alexander has worked hard to become a wonderful companion, and as part of APA&#039;s Total Obedience Program you can work with APA staff after adoption and master all the TOP dog skills together. Check out a video on APA&#039;s CGC program, on which the TOP was based https:\/\/vimeo.com\/89434193 Alexander&#039;s soulful eyes tell you he&#039;s grateful to be part of the APA! family but hopes to become a new addition to a home with new people and new toys to play with. Come meet this amazing pup!

This results in the patented Denise Belly Bow, where she&#039;s half ready for love and half ready to play - she rolls over her front half for maximum belly rubs, while keeping her bottom in the air just in case she needs to break out in zoomies! Like all overgrown puppies, Denise loves her toys, especially the squeaky ones, and she&#039;s a big fan of playing fetch. She definitely has some energy to get out, especially first thing in the morning, but settles down quickly once she&#039;s had some exercise and then just wants to snuggle and get belly rubs. She gives good night and good morning kisses and will cuddle with you on the bed all night if you&#039;ll let her. She also sleeps upside down and smiling, just in case there&#039;s a belly rub she might miss while sleeping. And if you long to be greeted as if you&#039;ve returned home from a 10 year odyssey every time you come back from HEB, Denise is your gal. She even sits on your feet to make extra sure you know you are loved. She&#039;ll follow you around the house wherever you go, including the kitchen where she&#039;ll politely asking for snacks with a very proper sit and those big beautiful eyes that are so hard to turn down. While Denise is definitely an enthusiastic pup, she&#039;s very eager to please her people, learns quickly and does great left alone - she&#039;s quiet, house-trained well-behaved and not destructive. Not sold yet? Then we should mention Denise&#039;s spots. She has secret spots that only appear when she&#039;s had a bath and her fur is wet! The perfect mix of playful and snuggly, whatever Denise does, she does it all the way.

Then he grew into a 70lb big, energetic puppy and they feel he&#039;s not quite the fit they expected.  CJ grew up to be 20lbs more than his mamma dog, who Lucky Lab saved from a shelter when she was pregnant. \n\n\n\n\n\nHere is what his current family says about CJ: \n\n\n\n\n\nCJ Stats:\n\n\nAge - 13 3\/4mos. (born 12\/03\/2017)\n\n\nWeight - approx. 67lbs.\n\n\n\n\n\nLikes:\n\n\nPlaying with Puppy Friends &amp; Human Family\n\n\nBeing Outdoors\n\n\nPlaying in the Doggy Pool\n\n\nPlaying Chase and Hide-N-Seek\n\n\nPlaying Fetch\n\n\nRunning &amp; Surveying the Land\n\n\nDoggy Daycare with Friends\n\n\nEggs &amp; Peanut Butter\n\n\nTraining Treats, Bully Sticks &amp; Buffalo Horns!\n\n\n\n\n\nDislikes:\n\n\n\n\n\nWe had a difficult time finding anything he dislikes.  He would probably dislike being indoors all day but, we arranged our daily schedules to give him as much outdoor time as possible (and when we couldn&#039;t do that, we had him participate in doggy daycare for the day).\n\n\n\n\n\nCJ is still kind of a big puppy who needs some more training.  He&#039;s a bit stubborn when you tell him to come back inside if he&#039;s playing outside.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe likes to naw on fluffy things like pillows and other stuff, but when you&#039;re a big puppy you need to be given proper toys and nylabones, etc. to chomp on. \n\n\n\n\n\nHis family says they are choosing to rehome CJ because they think he&#039;d do best with an active family who might even have another dog that he can play with, throw the ball and run around--  or he could go to dog daycare to play and burn off his energy. \n\n\n\n\n\nCJ enjoys running outside and playing so much when  he hasn&#039;t had enough time outside and\/or playing, he tries to expend his energy indoors by running around, jumping on everyone\/everything.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of our Lucky Lab volunteers went over and spent some time with CJ and he said: \n\n\n\n\n\nHe was very friendly to me, but constantly jumping on me for attention. He would jump up on my front, side, back, etc... He knows sit and lay down, but is not the most obedient about actually doing them for me (but did do it a number of times for me). \n\n\n\n\n\nGiven his size, the jumping would be a problem with small to medium size children. \n\n\n\n\n\nPer the adopter, he does very well at doggie day camp and plays with all sizes of dogs with no problems.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe is reported to bark at dogs and people while walking, but mostly because he wants to go play with then. We walked him a couple blocks in mist\/light rain, and we saw one postal employee filling a mailbox but he didn&#039;t react. No dogs on our walk so I could not observe\/confirm reaction to dogs. \n\n\n\n\n\nHe wears a gentle leader during walks and is okay with it, but doesn&#039;t like it being put on (was a little wrestling match but no aggression). Despite the gentle leader, he tended to walk with the leash fairly taught, staying at its limit without really dragging the male owner around.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe was non reactive to my petting any part of his body. He liked being touched, but was still wild and jumpy while I did it, never really settling down for long. \n\n\n\n\n\nI think he will do fine in any home that is willing to deal with 70 or so lbs of puppy energy. He needs better training especially as regards staying put and not jumping on people.\n\n\n\n\n\nCJ might do super well in a puppy\/young dog training class. Sounds like he wants to please, he just needs to have someone spend some time showing him direction and letting him burn off his energy.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can&#039;t tell you how many young adult dogs Lucky Lab has saved from the shelter who ended up there because they were young and full of energy, ate someone&#039;s shoes, and needed some refinement :). If you aren&#039;t ready for that don&#039;t adopt a young dog! Period. \n\n\n\n\n\nIf you&#039;re ready for a bundle of sweet, loving energy CJ is neutered, vaccinated and microchipped. \n\n\n\n\n\nApply at www.luckylabrescue.com"	"https:\/\/dl5zpyw5k3jeb.cloudfront.net\/photos\/pets\/44065099\/1\/?bust=1550715113"	"https:\/\/dl5zpyw5k3jeb.cloudfront.net\/photos\/pets\/44065099\/1\/?bust=1550715113","https:\/\/dl5zpyw5k3jeb.cloudfront.net\/photos\/pets\/44065099\/2\/?bust=1550715123","https:\/\/dl5zpyw5k3jeb.cloudfront.net\/photos\/pets\/44065099\/3\/?bust=1550715132","https:\/\/dl5zpyw5k3jeb.cloudfront.net\/photos\/pets\/44065099\/4\/?bust=1550715140"	"adoptable"	"House trained","Spay\/Neuter","Shots Current"	null	true	true	null	null	null	false	Lucky Lab Rescue and Adoption	not-adopted

Rufus is happy doing just about anything - whether that&#039;s zooming around the yard, chasing tennis balls, or lounging in mud puddles like the cutest little hippo you&#039;ve ever seen. Once he gets a few zoomies out of the way, he&#039;s ready to lounge around and watch a Netflix marathon. But no matter what he&#039;s doing, he&#039;s doing it with a huge grin and a huge tongue hanging out! His big smile and his wiggly butt are hard to resist. Rufus walks great on leash. He will happily hang out in his crate, but most of the time he doesn&#039;t need it - he stays home alone loose in the apartment while his foster parents are at work. He doesn&#039;t get on the furniture and has learned to stay out of certain areas of the house, like the kitchen. He loves attention and is especially fond of men. Very laid back and affectionate, Rufus loves to lay close by his people and gently remind them that they should be scratching his belly. But he also enjoys his alone time and will lounge on his bed or look out the window quietly while his people do things around the house. He&#039;s so happy to see his people every time they come home, he can&#039;t help doing a couple zoomies before rolling over for belly rubs. His quirks include laying with his feet sticking straight out behind him from under his chubby rear end and he often has very exciting dreams and makes adorable little barking and howling noises. APA!&#039;s favorite little hippo lives big and loves big. We can&#039;t wait for him to get into a home where his big love is reciprocated and where he gets all the snuggling he can handle. Come meet this goofy charmer today!"

He&#039;s 12 years old. \nThis dog is not with Small Chance Rescue, but a member of the public is trying to rehome him. Please contact Jenn at 903-357-0754 if you are interested in adopting him. Info from his owner below:\n\nMylo is great with dogs of all sizes, cats, rabbits... I\u2019ve yet to find an animal he isn\u2019t good with, he even plays well with a friend&#039;s crazy Min-Pin. He is not at all good with kids. He\u2019s never been great with them and the older he\u2019s gotten the worse he\u2019s gotten. He does tend to snap when someone pets him and he he doesn\u2019t want to or he\u2019s done being touched, which is new since the baby was born. He hates being outside for too long, something I think is due to him basically being a grouchy old man. He has faked injury for attention right after the baby was born.... So obviously personality for days. He loves his kennel, we call it his house and at bedtime we tell him to get in his house and he settles for the night. He is extremely attached to me to the point of aggression. He won\u2019t let anyone touch him if he\u2019s sitting by me and will growl and bite if they try. Every time Levi (baby) cries, Mylo yelps like he\u2019s been hurt. We\u2019ve done everything anyone has suggested and then some to fix this, as he has always been that way, but nothing has helped and it\u2019s gotten worse with the baby to the point of the attempted attack. He\u2019s had a very good obviously spoiled life but it\u2019s now to where we have to keep him and the baby safe, and finding a better home for Mylo seems to be the best option. He\u2019s in amazing health, I can get his records from the vet, if needed. He loves riding in the car and just being with me. He loves being lap dog and gives kisses. He\u2019s house broken, kennel trained, leash trained can sit stay and lay down."

Here at the Wags Ranch, I will be meeting new friends like donkeys, chickens and pigs and my trainers say that they expect I will love them as well. \n\nI WOULD RATHER NOT: Be ignored! I am a lap puppy for sure and would love a family that will let me cuddle up on them in the evenings and give me lots of affection.\n\nI NEED: A family that understands that while I am basically perfect in every way, I am still a puppy and sometimes will get into mischief. Training is very important for pups like me, so I need a family that will dedicate time to working with me. \n\n"	"https:\/\/dl5zpyw5k3jeb.cloudfront.net\/photos\/pets\/44115032\/2\/?bust=1551297869"	"https:\/\/dl5zpyw5k3jeb.cloudfront.net\/photos\/pets\/44115032\/2\/?bust=1551297869","https:\/\/dl5zpyw5k3jeb.cloudfront.net\/photos\/pets\/44115032\/3\/?bust=1551297853","https:\/\/dl5zpyw5k3jeb.cloudfront.net\/photos\/pets\/44115032\/4\/?bust=1551297865","https:\/\/dl5zpyw5k3jeb.cloudfront.net\/photos\/pets\/44115032\/5\/?bust=1551297867"	"adoptable"	"House trained","Spay\/Neuter","Shots Current"	null	true	true	true	null	null	false	Wags, Hope and Healing	not-adopted

She likes walks, not pulling on the leash.  She is good with kids 15 years up who are respectful of dogs.  Maggie is very laid back, but has now begun to engage her dog foster-brother to play, which is great!  She sits for treats and takes them very gently.  She does know sit, drop it, and off, and is ready to learn more fun things.  She is initially very shy when meeting, but becomes more comfortable with time.  Trust is important for her.  What she likes the best are:  treats, car rides, walks, sleeping on the bed, other dogs, belly rubs, window duty from the top of the armchair, and couch lounging with her head on the armrest.  She feels more comfortable with men but eventually warms up to women and children.  She is not crate trained but is house trained.  Maggie is up to date on vaccinations and spay.

From the latest bridle coat to the &#039;in&#039; on the floppiest ears, Brock knows he&#039;s the voice of his doggy generation! Like any good social media guru, Brock has his own hashtag #brockstar! Back in the day, you could see him hanging out in many a public place as the exemplary spokesdog of APA! Of course, Brock isn&#039;t all fluff. He understands the finer things in life - a soft bed, green grass to lounge in and nice strolls around the block. He knows all the ins and outs of living in a home and has been able to co-exist with chickens in the past and could also go home with a well-matched doggie sibling. He&#039;s also quite the &#039;Brockstar&#039; when it comes down to his skills. He walks nicely on leash, sits and shakes on commands and has the sweetest flop into your lap when he&#039;s ready for snuggles. As a Canine Good Citizen trainee Brock enjoys learning new things where he works with a volunteer trainer several times a week toward the goal of passing the American Kennel Club&#039;s CGC test. To pass the CGC test, a dog must demonstrate obedience and general reliability in real world situations. Dogs in the CGC program learn to sit calmly when approached by strangers or another dog, how to greet people appropriately, stay in a sit or down until told &#039;free,&#039; and come when called. Brock has been working hard to be a dog you can take anywhere with pride, and as part of APA&#039;s CGC program you can work with APA to continue to build a training relationship with him after adoption and get officially CGC certified for free!

As affectionate as she is, Josie doesn&#039;t give the big face kisses that make you scrunch your face. Instead, she&#039;ll get close, like she&#039;s sniffing you, and then daintily kisses your nose. Though Josie doesn&#039;t seem interested in playing with toys, whenever her friends at the shelter bring her a toy, she seems absolutely tickled and pleased that they&#039;ve brought her a gift, like &#039;Oh, I can&#039;t use this right now, but thank you so much for thinking of me!&#039; She walks wonderfully on leash, but is pretty low to medium energy and likes to sniff rather than go long distances. And she loves to roll around outside - not just in the grass, but also on the pavement, even if she&#039;s wearing a coat! But her favorite place in the world is definitely snuggled up next to you with her head in your lap. This good-natured young lady has really enjoyed playgroup in the past and be more than happy to go back to hanging with her canine buddies as soon as her knee is back to normal. She has an injured knee that needs surgery and is eager to find her loving home that will help her heal back to 100%. APA will handle her treatment, she just needs you to give her lots of love to help her recover. Josie can be a little shy at first with new people, but she&#039;ll be asking for pets by the end of the first meeting by rubbing her head and body against your legs and nudging your hand if you stop petting her, though with that irresistibly soft fur, that probably won&#039;t be an issue. This big cuddler loves affection more than treats, so much so, that when her trainers work with her, they primarily rewarding her with affection! She knows sit and is pretty good with recall and come, though it&#039;s hard to practice those, since Josie is kind of a velcro dog and wants to be by your side constantly! Josie is also APA!&#039;s Total Obedience Program (TOP), which is modeled after the AKC&#039;s Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test. As a TOP dog, Josie has a personalized training plan and works with a volunteer trainer several times a week to help her learn the skills to become the best dog she can be! Josie is learning skills like sit and down, sitting calmly when approached by strangers or other dogs, staying in a sit or down until told &#039;free,&#039; coming when called and &#039;place&#039;, which means Josie will go to a specific place in your home on command. Once Josie successfully completes all the skills on her training plan, she will be considered TOP Dog Ready! Josie is working hard to become a wonderful companion, and as a part of APA&#039;s Total Obedience Program you can work with APA staff to continue to build a training relationship with Josie after adoption and master all the TOP dog skills together. Check out a video on APA&#039;s CGC program, on which the TOP was based: https:\/\/vimeo.com\/89434193 Loving, sweet and low key, Josie would make a wonderful companion and she can&#039;t wait to daintily smother you in her love and precious kisses!

She&#039;s still figuring out how this whole beloved family dog thing works, and while she&#039;s not so playful with toys yet, since she probably never had any before, she&#039;s definitely curious about them. And she really likes the regular meals part of the deal. More than anything, Mildred wants to be loved and feel that she&#039;s safe. She&#039;s a sweet, gentle, submissive soul who loves nothing more than being by her person&#039;s side, getting as close as possible and looking at them with those adoring eyes, asking to be pet. She makes the perfect movie-watching buddy, and she loves meeting new people, since they always seem to want to pet her too. Despite not having any training, Mildred is incredibly well-behaved. She&#039;s house-trained and does great left alone outside of a crate. She&#039;s quiet, non-destructive and happy to nap in her bed until you get home. Mildred&#039;s a pretty low energy lady and walks perfectly on leash. She never pulls, and she&#039;s curious about any homes where she knows a dog lives. She&#039;s also done great with the dogs in her foster home. Mildred would make a wonderful addition to any number of loving homes that will let her know she&#039;s part of the family and include her on their adventures.

Rustler is a handsome, healthy young adult who would love to settle in with a family where this fun dog will put a smile on everyone&#039;s face. Rustler is overall a pretty chill guy but he&#039;s ready for anything - a long walk or run, hanging out in the yard or even just some couch surfing. He doesn&#039;t need much and doesn&#039;t have an overly energetic demeanor that needs constant attention. He&#039;s just a cool guy who&#039;s very affectionate and loves to be with his people. He&#039;s got an ever-present bounce in his step that reflects his sunny outlook and just wants to be everyone&#039;s friend. Rustler is fantastic on a leash and doesn&#039;t get distracted by other people or dogs, as he keeps his focus on his walking partner. He is extremely obedient and behaves very well without a lot of management. He&#039;s lived in home before so he knows to follow the rules. Rustler also enjoys learning new things and is in the Total Obedience Program. The Total Obedience Program (TOP) is modelled after the AKC&#039;s Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test. As a TOP dog, Rustler has a personalized training plan and works with a volunteer trainer several times a week to help him learn the skills to become the best dog he can be! He is learning skills like sit and down, walking nicely on leash, sitting calmly when approached by strangers or other dogs, staying in a sit or down until told &#039;free,&#039; and coming when called. Once Rustler successfully completes all the skills on his training plan he will be considered TOP Dog Ready! Rustler is working hard to become a wonderful pet, and as a part of APA&#039;s Total Obedience Program you can work with APA staff to continue to build a training relationship with him after adoption and master all the TOP dog skills together. Check out a video on APA&#039;s CGC program, on which the TOP was based: https:\/\/vimeo.com\/89434193. Rustler&#039;s looking for a home where he can get some cuddle time and a soft place to lay his brindle head. Come meet him and see if he&#039;s right for yours!"

When she first arrived in foster, it was clear she was used to getting up on furniture, but when she did get on the furniture and was told &#039;no&#039;, it took her no time for her to understand and it hasn&#039;t been an issue since. She does get to sleep in the their 17 year-old&#039;s bed with him and she loves that. She also asks to go out in the backyard by herself to relax in the grass or sun on the deck. Shatzi does very well left home alone in a crate, and when her people are getting ready to leave, she gets in her kennel on her own and waits for them to give her a treat and close the door. She has excellent leash skills, doesn&#039;t pull, and when she gets back from the walk, she stays in a &#039;sit&#039; before being invited into the house.

She&#039;s goes right up to new people, wagging her tail and hoping they&#039;ll pet her. She loves the attention and will try and cuddle on whoever will let her. When Rasta first got in the car with her foster mom, she was so excited that she hopped right on her lap and looked out the window, ready for whatever adventures awaited her. Then the first thing Rasta did when she got home was fall asleep on her foster mom&#039;s lap. This sweet girl LOVES to cuddle, and she will climb right up on the couch and lay on top of you. And if the lap&#039;s not an option, she insists on having at least some part of her body touching you. She even puts her paws on you and tries to pull you closer to her. While Rasta likes getting out for her walks, she is extremely calm and chill in the house. She pretty much just falls asleep whenever it&#039;s tv time, but then gets very excited to go outside. She already knows sit, shake and down, and she even sits on her own when the leash comes out, though her tail wags the entire time. Actually, Rasta&#039;s tail literally never stops wagging. She&#039;s just so happy to be doing anything with her people, whether that&#039;s inside doing nothing or outside in the sunshine. She follows her foster mom around like an adorable shadow - whether she&#039;s doing the dishes or just getting something out of the closet, Rasta is right there, laying at her feet wherever she stops. Rasta is house-trained, does very well left alone and doesn&#039;t bark or cry when you leave the house. She does great uncrated, just sleeping on the couch and never chews anything or gets into anything she&#039;s not supposed to. She listens when you call her and just a very obedient dog. Affectionate, loyal, adaptable, low maintenance and so well-behaved, Rasta would make a wonderful addition to any number of loving homes who will give her plenty of attention and include her in their activities. In return, she promises to love you forever. Come meet this sweet girl!"

44160094	719.4482143897849	"English Setter"	"null"	false	"White \/ Cream"	"Adult"	"Female"	"Medium"	"Short"	"Sugar"	"Hi, my name is Sugar and you might ask how I got to be so sweet. After all, in my seven years in this world, I have changed homes at least six times! Starting out as a non-hunter just minutes from being listed on Craigslist by a Texas backyard breeder\/hunter, I was saved by SWESR, but moved from foster to adopter to foster to adopter; you get the picture. The thing is it was through no fault of my own. Sadly, my persons met with unfortunate accidents, illnesses, and did the very best for me by recognizing they could no longer take care of an active young dog. The best part is that I was loved and respected on each stop. If it weren\u2019t for all those persons being so nice to me, I just wouldn\u2019t have become the sweet Setter I am today. My name definitely fits. But now I need a permanent furever home.\n\nI am a happy, healthy, girl with sparkling brown eyes and a smile as big as the world. My coat is the softest white, and I sport one quite fetching apricot patch on my left ear. While I love snuggling on the couch with the best, I am certainly not a couch potato! I need daily walks and a large fenced yard with lots of room to run. If you are looking for a fabulous walking companion, I am your girl. And while I might be a little excited to start off, by some Setter miracle, I do not pull on my leash. And besides as a pocket-setter, I only weigh a slim and trim 35 pounds. I promise to be your best buddy, inside and out.\n\nI am crate-trained and am happy to do all my business outside as long as you will go out with me regularly and not forget me outside. My current foster Mom is so impressed how well I fit in with her pack of dogs and cats so quickly. She thinks I will do best with another dog brother or sister who will join me in playing and being busy in the backyard, with you not too far away of course. And she thinks I need a person who will give me lots of singular attention and be with me most of the time. That\u2019s because when I am left alone too much, I get a little worried and nervous that I\u2019ll be shipped off yet again. I really want the chance to a part of a stable, active family who will enjoy being with me forever.\n\nI get nervous in the car and then curl into a ball so I am not a candidate for a long volunteer transport to a new home and flying to a new home would be scary for me and I might cry the entire way. I\u2019ll do ok in the car with my new person after I have some time to realize I am not going anywhere other than an outing.\n\nI learned some really quick escape skills in a previous home where I was able to bolt out of the door and go for run-abouts. Sometimes I came back on my own, sometimes they had to come corral me back. My foster mom says I need a home with very secure doors and gates and a home with kids coming and going won\u2019t be a good match for me because I am certain to take advantage of any open door or gate. And I won\u2019t come back when you call me. After all I\u2019ve been through she says a very secure home is a must for me.\n\nWhen I arrived at my current foster home near Austin, TX, I was all decked out in pink: collar, leash, harness, and crate. And you guessed it, I am pretty in pink, but I really don\u2019t care what color my leash is, just as long as there is a loving and lively person at the end of it.\n\nSugar is spayed, up-to-date on vaccinations and tests, on heartworm preventative and microchipped.\n\n\nFor an application to adopt or for more information about Southwest English Setter Rescue including our adoption requirements and transport availability, please go to http:\/\/www.swesr.org\/.

Kit is so overjoyed by a good butt scratch that he folds himself up into a fat furry donut of love and happiness when he gets them. Belly rubs too. It&#039;s not uncommon to look over and see Kit sitting nearby with a big smile on his face, waiting for you to give him some. This handsome guy is a huge fan of people and will follow you around the house and nudge you with his nose to let you know it&#039;s time for pets if it&#039;s been a while. And as long as Kit gets a healthy dose of affection, he&#039;s generally happy to lay by your feet while you work or watch tv. Kit really loves walking around with tennis balls in his mouth, and he&#039;ll even carefully select one out before he goes for a walk: &#039;Hmm, what are we in the mood for today, old chap? Perhaps a Penn 100? Smells like it was a good year.&#039; Kit&#039;s also a pretty low maintenance pup to have around. He has wonderful manners in the home, he&#039;s house-trained and will tell you when he needs to go out. He walks great on leash as long as you keep an eye out for squirrels (this boy gets very excited about those darn squirrels), he knows &#039;sit&#039; and is perfectly well-behaved when left home alone. Kit&#039;s one of those dogs who can&#039;t help but bring a smile to your face. And who doesn&#039;t need more of that in their life? Come meet this great pup!"

I&#039;m up for anything!&#039; Axel loves to play and is so adorable when he&#039;s doing it! He&#039;s like a big happy puppy - he loves all toys and is a big fan of playing fetch and tug of war. While he can be shy when meeting new men, once he warms up, he becomes a very affectionate guy who wants to be pet all over and will climb right up in your lap to smother you with kisses! Axel gets all happy and wiggly when he knows he&#039;s going for a walk - he&#039;s amazing on leash, loves to go for runs and stays right by your side, making great eye contact. Axel is so eager to please his people and is very treat-motivated, so training&#039;s a snap. He&#039;s also fully house and crate-trained, hasn&#039;t shown any destructive tendencies in the home, and he knows how to shake with both paws! As much as Axel loves to play and go on adventures, he has a medium energy level and settles in nicely at home, happy to snuggle in close for a night in. Axel is learning all kinds of new skills in APA!&#039;s Total Obedience Program. The Total Obedience Program (TOP) is modeled after the AKC&#039;s Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test. As a TOP dog, Axel has a personalized training plan and works with a volunteer trainer several times a week to help him learn the skills to become the best dog he can be! Axel is learning skills like sit and down, sitting calmly when approached by strangers or other dogs, staying in a sit or down until told &#039;free,&#039; coming when called and &#039;place, which means he will go to a specific place in your home on command. Once Axel successfully completes all the skills on his training plan, he will be considered TOP Dog Ready! Axel is working hard to become a wonderful companion, and as a part of APA&#039;s Total Obedience Program you can work with APA staff to continue to build a training relationship with Axel after adoption and master all the TOP dog skills together. Check out a video on APA&#039;s CGC program, on which the TOP was based: https:\/\/vimeo.com\/89434193 Fun-loving, gentle and so very sweet, Axel will make some lucky person very happy. When he looks at you with those adoring eyes, we think you&#039;ll be won over instantly. Come meet this great pup!"

Before she came to APA!, Brennan had a pretty rough life, but other than not understanding what to do with toys at first, you could hardly tell with how cuddly she is. Brennan revels in the amounts of affection lavished on her by her friends at the shelter, and her absolute favorite thing is being in their laps. She particularly loves when her friends hold her like a baby and rock her back and forth. And we hope you like dog kisses, because Brennan loves to love her people right back! Brennan has a moderate energy level but still enjoys her walks and does well on leash. She also does fine being left home alone in her crate, as long as she has her beloved chew toys to keep her company.

This handsome fella shares a several traits to his famous name-sake. Most striking are his baby blue eyes. You truly can get lost in his puppy dog eyes! Pictures do not due him justice. He also has the best hair!!! So soft and silky. He&#039;s such a lush. He loves to be cuddled and snuggled. Also like his name-sake, Cooper is such a charmer. So loving and sweet, playful and silly. Unfortunately for being only 3 months old he&#039;s experienced some of the worst things in life already. There&#039;s a lot we don&#039;t know, but what we do know is that he has a spinal injury. Perhaps from being hit by a car? It&#039;s unclear. He was also dumped at a high killer shelter by his previous foster. Can you believe it? He deserves nothing but the best in life, but he&#039;s has a rough start and a long road ahead. He currently doesn&#039;t control over his hind legs. All he wants to do is run and play, like every other puppy, but has very limited mobility. He&#039;s doing GREAT given everything he&#039;s been through and incredibly resilient. Cooper is the perfect little gentleman. He&#039;s smart and picking up commands very quickly and highly motivated to please. The road to recovery is still unclear, and we&#039;ll keep you updated!!! So keep checking back on the journey. We are currently accepting donations and application from adoption."

Yes; Crate Trained? No, high anxiety in crates; Heartworm Negative; Current on Heartworm Prevention; Neutered;\u00a0Not microchipped; Good with other dogs; Don&#039;t know about cats;\u00a0Good with children.\u00a0\n\nRiley is literally one of the sweetest, most attention-loving dogs you will ever meet. He is good-natured, but very high energy and high anxiety. He is slightly small for a full grown male at 63 pounds. His coat is short and healthy with minimal shedding. \u00a0\n\nRiley loves to play fetch and be petted, and is extremely patient with kids (my baby would pull and hit on him and he would just let her). Riley needs a lot of attention. \u00a0He would do very well in a home with someone that is there most of the day, or with several children or other dogs.\n\nRiley has anxiety and does not liked to be locked up. \u00a0If you need to lock him in a crate or room he will relentlessly scratch and try to figure a way out. \u00a0In fact he knows how to open some unlocked doors, and once scraped his face &amp; scratched his eye to escape from a crate, so he would not do well in a home that requires crating.\n\nRiley also likes to roam, so he needs a new home with a backyard that has a completely fenced perimeter with 6&#039; height. (He easily jumps over 4&#039; fences). He is too smart about finding ways to escape, but always comes home and tries to open the front door to get back in.\n\nDISCLAIMERS:\u00a0\n\u2022 German Shepherd Rescue of Central Texas claims no responsibility for the descriptions or temperaments of any dogs listed as a referral.\u00a0\n\u2022 We have not met these dogs, evaluated them, or verified claims made by owner or contact person. \u00a0\n\u2022 We do not own or take responsibility or liability for any completed\u00a0adoption or transaction made regarding these dogs.\n\u2022 Potential adopters are expected to seek out any and all information on health,\u00a0temperament, and past behaviors prior to adopting.\u00a0 \n\n"	"https:\/\/dl5zpyw5k3jeb.cloudfront.net\/photos\/pets\/44186379\/1\/?bust=1552090261"	"https:\/\/dl5zpyw5k3jeb.cloudfront.net\/photos\/pets\/44186379\/1\/?bust=1552090261"	"adoptable"	"House trained","Spay\/Neuter"	null	true	true	null	null	null	false	German Shepherd Rescue Central Texas	not-adopted

I was found dumped at a local grocery store roaming around the parking lot begging for anyone to help me. It was 28 degrees outside and I was cold and hungry. Thankfully, some SNIPSA people happened to be the ones I chose to follow around that evening and they immediately took me in. After a warm bath, a belly full of food, and a nice welcome from their resident pup, I was finally happy and relaxed. They brought me to SNIPSA where I got everything I needed to be a healthy girl ready to find my very own forever home! I have to say I have fully embraced this pet life! I absolutely enjoy the company of my human and four-legged family members. I love to be loved on and am very submissive. I don\u2019t mind water when taking my baths\u2026it sort of reminds me of a relaxing spa day. I am quickly picking up house training and crate training and walk pretty well on a leash if I do say so myself.

He&#039;s a 80 lb. hunk of Love.... he loves other dogs, kids (we recommend they be 12 and older) and people! Everywhere he goes, people are drawn to his striking looks and sweet temperament. If you&#039;re looking for a love bug on the larger size, we have you covered! Tiger is very smart and observative. While at the refuge he has learned many commands as well as how to control his puppy ways in order to have manners. He&#039;s been on many social outings and would definitely make a wonderful &quot;sidekick&quot; for an individual or the whole family. While we haven&#039;t seen him in a home, we believe he&#039;ll be somewhat of a couch potato who will be happy to have a few play rounds, romps or walks a day. He doesn&#039;t tolerate extended heat too well so don&#039;t count on him being a running partner. Tiger would love a home with another dog or two he could play with...any size but the bigger the better! He would do well where there is an area big enough to get his romp on before he lounges in some shade. He loves children but, as with any dog of his size, needs supervision for now around the little ones because he&#039;s still a pup at heart and, in high excitement, still wants to jump. A stronger willed owner to give him consistent direction will ensure he blooms into the wonderful family companion we know he will be. To meet Tiger in person, fill out an adoption application on our website, wimberleywagrescue.org, and then we&#039;ll contact you. Thank you!"

This rescue has quite the story and we hope you take the time\nto read it. Surrendered to SNIPSA several months ago from her owner of many\nyears, we thought Sookie\u2019s biggest hurdle in finding her a home would be her age.\nYet we knew her breed and cute little face would wiggle its way into someone\u2019s\nheart. She received a flurry of interest in just days of her posting on our website and\nlanded herself an adoptive home. All seemed well until her adopter grew very ill and\nreturned Sookie to SNIPSA. We were faced with finding her yet another adoptive\nfamily. And this is where her story get\u2019s more colorful.\n\nSookie had a mild cough but just enough of a cough that we thought it may need\nfurther attention. A battery of tests were performed which showed a primary lung\ntumor. Bad news for our Sookie but good news we had some wonderful surgeons on\nour side. She underwent another battery of tests including a CT scan, more\nbloodwork, and additional x-rays (can you see the dollar signs adding up?) There\ndidn\u2019t appear to be involvement in the adjacent lymph nodes or evidence of other\nneoplasia. Tumors like this had a decent prognosis so we decided to give her the\nbenefit of the doubt with surgery. Dr. Israel and her team at Blue Pearl went to work\nopening her chest and removed the diseased lung and tumor. She spent a few nights\nin an oxygen cage with a chest tube \u2013 a dog ICU of sorts. Two days later, she was\nready to be discharged! Dogs have an incredible way of healing and she was no\ndifferent. And the best news yet\u2026the biopsy revealed a low-grade malignancy with\ncomplete excision of the tumor. We expect Sookie to live several more fruitful years.\n\nOur sweet Sookie is back up for adoption and looking oh so fashionable in her pink\nt-shirt. She wags her tail, eagerly waits for her foster mom, and lounges on her\nfavorite dog pillow. She can go on walks and be treated like any regular 10 year-old\ndog. She is easy going, mild mannered, housebroken, devoted beyond measure, and\nthe perfect lady. She has had one noteworthy adoption story in her short time in our\ncare and we are ready to find her a lifelong home. Please give her a chance. Fill out an application for Sookie at www.snipsa.org!"

My tail will keep time to whatever\u2019s playing! And I\u2019ll never change the station in the middle of your favorite song because that\u2019s just rude.\n\nFor a while there, my life was like a sad country song. Somehow I ended up alone on the street during one of the coldest weeks in recent history. Thankfully, a lady took pity on me and brought me in out of the cold. I don\u2019t usually brag, but I suspect my dashing good looks and charming personality sucked her in. Plus, it didn\u2019t hurt that I know how to be a good houseguest.\n\nTurns out, people are easily impressed. I mean, they\u2019re all gushing about how smart I am just because I\u2019m housetrained, crate trained, not destructive, love other dogs and kids, and I\u2019ll sit and lie down on command. Cattle Dogs are known for their smarts, so little do they know, I\u2019m capable of way more than what I\u2019m currently letting on! I mean, the above qualities are good, but just wait till you start to train me and I\u2019ll give you something to be impressed about. Plus, everyone knows it\u2019s important to keep learning new things in life. Who knows, you might even learn a thing or two from me! For example, I can teach you how to be cool. It just seems to come naturally to me! Everyone who meets me says so anyway. Thanks, y\u2019all! Back atcha!\n\nNow, I could see how you might be thinking I sound like the perfect dog right about now, but because dogs are incapable of lying, I\u2019m going to confess something I hope won\u2019t be a deal breaker. There was one time when I was first rescued that they left me outside overnight and that\u2019s when they learned two things about me:\n1) I\u2019d rather be inside with you \u2013 No brainer!\nand\n2) I have no problem scaling a 6\u2019 fence\nMy current foster spends lots of time with me, plus they have other dogs to keep me company, so they\u2019ve never seen any signs of me wanting to escape. I\u2019m a fast learner, after all. I know a good thing when it\u2019s right in front of me. But they\u2019re not my forever home, I\u2019m just crashing here till my own special person comes along! They\u2019ve gotten to know me pretty well and they think I\u2019d do great with another playful dog to hang out with. Or if you want me to be your only dog, that\u2019s ok as long as you have time to spend with me.\n\nSo there it is. The good, the bad, and, well there is no ugly here! What do you say? If you make me your Roadie, I\u2019ll worship you like a rock star and pretty soon you\u2019ll be my biggest fan in return.\n\nIf you would like to meet me or just want to get more information on me just call 210-619-1980 or email info@homesforpets.org."

Good with dogs, but he definitely prefers to stand his time attached to your leg. He ignored the cat when confronted with one.  Easy going and.quiet.  Does not do well in a crate.

Give him a bone and Fred will entertain himself all day with it. \n\n\n\n\n\nHe&#039;s never lived in a home with young kids, so we aren&#039;t sure how he would do, but overall he is incredibly sweet. \n\n\n\n\n\nFred does well with overall dogs, he is friendly and happy. When we got Fred he wasn&#039;t neutered, but now he is. He has had a little residual, how do we say, &quot;humpy-ness&quot; just with dogs, but he&#039;s now getting better that his post neuter testosterone is dropping. \n\n\n\n\n\nLOL, so now he&#039;s neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, house trained and Fred deserves a great home! \n\n\n\n\n\nIf you&#039;d like to apply for this gorgeous boy please go to www.luckylabrescue.com\n"	"https:\/\/dl5zpyw5k3jeb.cloudfront.net\/photos\/pets\/44240121\/1\/?bust=1552694514"	"https:\/\/dl5zpyw5k3jeb.cloudfront.net\/photos\/pets\/44240121\/1\/?bust=1552694514","https:\/\/dl5zpyw5k3jeb.cloudfront.net\/photos\/pets\/44240121\/2\/?bust=1552694523"	"adoptable"	"House trained","Spay\/Neuter","Shots Current"	null	null	true	null	null	null	false	Lucky Lab Rescue and Adoption	not-adopted

Alex is a sweet, happy boy who loves to play. He is just as content to play with a toy by himself, tossing it in the air and shaking it, as he is having you throw it and running after it. Sometimes he even brings it back but he&#039;s working on it! He is a good mix of being very affectionate and independent. He has a quirky smile (a broken jaw that didn&#039;t get treated) but it doesn&#039;t seem to bother him and he can eat well and has no problem taking treats softly from your hand. It also doesn&#039;t bother him to have one good eye. He is a loveable, bouncy boy that would love to be in his furever home...are you that special person who could fulfill his wish?\n\n** Please note: Due to their size, our dogs are not suitable for homes with children under 5..\n\nWe do not have a facility, all dogs are fostered in the homes of our volunteers. If you are interested in adopting a dog from Lil&#039; Paws Maltese Rescue and other Petite Paws, please visit our website at www.lilpaws-malteserescue.org and fill out an adoption application. This is the first step in our adoption process. Our goal is to place our dogs in safe, stable and loving homes in the Austin Metropolitan area. Thanks for looking!\n\nLil&#039; Paws Maltese Rescue and other Petite Paws depends on donations to keep the dogs in our program healthy. Many health issues are taken care of before a dog leaves a rescue: spaying, neutering, immunizations, dental care, and in some cases major surgery. Because of the cost of this care, donations are essential to enable us to continue our work. If you would like to show appreciation for what we do and help us continue to do it please go to our website homepage and click the donate button. We thank you in advance for your support."

My Ideal Date  I\u2019m a pretty laid back guy so I would love a quiet stroll through the national park while we enjoy the company of one another. We could keep it low key and go back home to watch the game and relax with a cold one afterwards, or we could stay out and see the sights and picnic. I will also say that ending the date with a few kisses is probably a given.  Send me a message if you\u2019d like to share your home with me. Of course I\u2019m up for a long-term place to call home, but if a short-term foster commitment is more your thing I can be flexible.  ***Want to learn more about this sweet boy?

She says the world is ready for me, or maybe it\u2019s I\u2019m ready for the world... hmm. At any rate, not sure what to say. I guess I should start with my name. Mama named me BlueJeans. She keeps humming when she says my name and sometimes says \u201cforever in blue jeans.\u201d That mama. Silly lady. There\u2019s also a foster daddy and I love him so much. I get so excited for his pets that I make little squeaky sounds because I just can\u2019t hold in my excitement sometimes. There are also two younger humans and four other dogs here. I think they\u2019re all great. \n\nI\u2019m a bit embarrassed to share this, but when I first came to my foster family they said there were a few things that needed tending to. They immediately took me to the groomer who said I was just fantastic, a natural! Next up was a cherry eye repair, and a couple other things. I did need a dental cleaning (mama said my breath could clear a room!). Turns out I needed much more than that. I had extensive work done and the end result was getting to keep only two teeth. I don\u2019t want to complain because everyone has been so nice to me, but I was pretty sore. But I\u2019m starting to feel better and pretty soon I will be ready to meet my new family. A few more things. I am 8 years young. I love going on walks and foster mama says I am the best walker out of the bunch. I know exactly where to do my business, which foster daddy in particular really likes. Mama says that I like to \u201ctalk\u201d a lot so no apartments or homes with shared walls for me! I also am very skilled at begging for people food so she says my furever home needs to be disciplined in that area. I really adapt amazingly well. Mama also says I\u2019m a pretty and petite girl.

He is about six months old and weighs 40lbs. \n\n\n\n\n\nGibbs has never met a stranger! \n\n\n\n\n\nHe is so excited to meet new people and dogs!  We don&#039;t know how he is with cats.  But with dogs he is \n\n\ngreat with pooches of all sizes, very submissive. \n\n\n\n\n\nHe&#039;s pretty chill too. \n\n\n\n\n\nGibbs is house trained, and we are working on ringing the bell when he needs to go out. \n\n\n\n\n\nAs of now he will just go and sit by the front door, so we are working on making sure he is &#039;louder&#039; or more assertive when he needs to go outside. \n\n\n\n\n\nGibbs has shown major improvement in the crate area. He will go to the crate when he is told and does well sleeping in it at night; although, he prefers to sleep with his humans. \n\n\n\n\n\nGibbs will stay in his crate during the day, although he does not like being left alone in it. \n\n\n\n\n\nGibbs has never been left home alone out of his crate but does wonderfully when people are home.\n\n\nThis dog would do better going to dog daycare or being adopted by someone who works from home and can hang out with him. \n\n\n\n\n\nHe has not been exposed to kids that we know of. \n\n\n\n\n\nGibbs is not very interested in toys or fetching. However, every now and then he will lay down and chew on a toy\/show it attention. He loves chew bones and toys.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile Gibbs does know how to walk on a leash and does not pull, he likes to do his business and go back inside. He is not fond of walking places he is unfamiliar with. \n\n\n\n\n\nHe is more scared on leash than off; however, he has not yet mastered coming when called but he never strays far from his humans\/fellow dog companion.  \n\n\n\n\n\nGibbs has mastered sit, shake, crate &amp; drop it. We are still working on lay, come, and down. \n\n\n\n\n\nCutest behavior: Gibbs is the biggest cuddler. This guy is one of the sweetest dogs his fosters have ever met which is hard for them to say considering their own bias towards their own dogs. He loves to lay around with his humans. \n\n\n\n\n\nGibbs has gotten use to playing with his mouth while playing with other dogs and will sometimes grab your hand or arm for attention with his mouth. While it is never hard, it is a negative behavior we are working on. Since he still has some puppy play skills we&#039;d recommend he only goes to a home with older kids or adults.  We just never want something misinterpreted or a young child getting scared. \n\n\n\n\n\nHe is neutered, vaccinated and microchipped. \n"	"https:\/\/dl5zpyw5k3jeb.cloudfront.net\/photos\/pets\/44284765\/1\/?bust=1553190108"	"https:\/\/dl5zpyw5k3jeb.cloudfront.net\/photos\/pets\/44284765\/1\/?bust=1553190108","https:\/\/dl5zpyw5k3jeb.cloudfront.net\/photos\/pets\/44284765\/2\/?bust=1553190143","https:\/\/dl5zpyw5k3jeb.cloudfront.net\/photos\/pets\/44284765\/3\/?bust=1553190155","https:\/\/dl5zpyw5k3jeb.cloudfront.net\/photos\/pets\/44284765\/4\/?bust=1553190170","https:\/\/dl5zpyw5k3jeb.cloudfront.net\/photos\/pets\/44284765\/5\/?bust=1553190193","https:\/\/dl5zpyw5k3jeb.cloudfront.net\/photos\/pets\/44284765\/6\/?bust=1553190206"	"adoptable"	"House trained","Spay\/Neuter","Shots Current"	null	true	true	null	null	null	false	Lucky Lab Rescue and Adoption	not-adopted

Mondo is learning skills like sit and down, walking nicely on leash, sitting calmly when approached by strangers or other dogs, staying in a sit or down until told &#039;free,&#039; coming when called and &#039;place&#039;, which means he will go to a specific place in your home on command.

Other than looking for a bit of attention, Diane really doesn&#039;t ask for much and makes for a very low key companion. She just seems so appreciative having a soft bed and regular meals, and she was the perfect houseguest on an extended sleepover with her virtual foster, spending most of the time napping. In fact she was so quiet, her foster almost forgot she was there! Diane is pretty shy at first and likes to take her time with new people and places. When she first arrived at her foster&#039;s apartment, she took her time exploring the space, and then seemed to enjoy having a quiet place to stay out of the shelter. When she saw things were safe, she hopped up on the bed, then let out a long sigh before conking out and snoring contently. She&#039;d occasionally come check on her person and wag her tail and get some pets, then ventured into the kitchen to see what was happening in there and was excited to find that&#039;s where they kept the string cheese! Diane is fully house-trained and is great about letting you know when she needs to go out. Out on walks, she doesn&#039;t pull on the leash and looks to her person for guidance as to what she&#039;s supposed to do. She also bravely hops right in and out of the car, even if she&#039;s a bit unsure of the destination. Low maintenance and so appreciative of her people, Diane would make a wonderful addition to any number of loving homes and maybe one with a well-matched doggie sibling to show her the ropes and help build her confidence.

She loves belly rubs and butt scratches and gives very gentle kisses. She also gives her foster mom hugs every time she gets home from work - she walks right up and lays her head on her chest, waiting for the embrace. Amy can be shy with strangers, but she warms up quickly, and once she&#039;s comfortable, her eyes are filled with love and affection whenever she looks at her people. Amy&#039;s preferred mode of play is to chase or be chased. Her favorite thing is to get a ball and then wait for someone to try to get it from her. Then she runs around the yard and stops, waits for you to try to get it, then she&#039;s off again: repeat until you&#039;re tired. When you&#039;re all chased out, Amy&#039;s happy to go practice on the squirrels. As much as she loves her walks and playtime, Amy overall has a pretty moderate energy level and is content to spend a lot of time just snoozing around the house. Amy is also an excellent houseguest - she&#039;s house-trained, and while she enjoys being in her crate, she behaves perfectly when left home alone outside of one, and she sleeps quietly through the night. She walks well on leash and is even up for a jog if you are. She&#039;s super smart too and already knows sit, down, roll over, stay and come.

Her foster mom says she&#039;s human-like in her displays of affection and that she has never met a dog so soft and sweet. Princess is one of those rare dogs that gives hugs and will even say thank you - when you put her harness on, she kisses and nudges you, and looks into your eyes in very appreciate way. Same with when you give her food, or put her bed down. She also loves to give kisses and will follow you from room to room like an adorable shadow. Princess is also extremely playful, but isn&#039;t pushy about it. She enjoys playing tug of war and loves moving her toys from room to room, getting them organized. Her favorite stuffed animal is a Scooby Dog and she uses him as a pillow or cuddles him in between her paws as she sleeps. She&#039;s also really into bones and pig ears. She likes to bury them outside or inside in blankets and boxes. Her other favorite &#039;toys&#039; are shoes, which her foster parents allow her to play with as she doesn&#039;t really chew them and likes to gingerly hold them in her mouth. She really loves sandals and bringing assorted ones to you. She also loves being outside where she sprints and jumps like a deer, and she also likes to go swimming. Princes is house-broken and is making great progress on her leash skills. She does great left home alone outside of her crate. She loves her bed, and even found a box with blankets to make herself a second bed, much like a cat. We think Princess would likely do well with a well-matched doggie sibling. She&#039;s a little shy with new people and dogs and doesn&#039;t seem to know what to make of them. She barks, but with a wagging tail, and just seems so uncertain whether these are potential friends or not. But she&#039;s is extremely sweet and loving with people once she&#039;s familiar with them and the same might go for other pups. Kind, intelligent, empathetic and so much fun, Princess is truly one of a kind. She&#039;d love a home with people who will included her in their activities and hopefully a yard to romp in.

Glendale warms up quickly, and after he know a stranger is safe, he will go up and ask for pets. Glendale is a pretty chill guy and definitely has lower energy levels than the average dog of his age. He likes to play and get in some exercise, but he&#039;s also content to spend a lot of time lounging. He enjoys going for walks and does well on leash, but what he really loves is hanging out with his people and spending quality time with his toys, especially cloth toys that squeak. He&#039;s also a big fan of tennis balls, and will play some light fetch inside the house. He will come immediately to the sound of a squeaky toy or put his toy near you to let you know it&#039;s time to throw it. Because Glendale has abnormalities in his back legs that affect his mobility, his playtime is kept to a minimum, but he&#039;s a lower energy pup anyway, so he&#039;s fine with doing a lot of relaxing. The ideal home for Glendale would have few or no stairs as it is difficult for him to move up or down them (He can be carried and is really receptive to that). Glendale is house-trained and a really quiet pup to have around. He walks pretty well on leash, and he sits when his leash comes out or when you put out food. He doesn&#039;t seem to actually know the command sit, but he sits anyway when he knows he&#039;s supposed to. He&#039;s pretty calm whenever he gets bathed, he takes medication easily and is willing to do whatever you need him to do. His foster parents experimented by putting a raincoat on him and he was like &#039;Yeah, I guess that&#039;s fine, go ahead.&#039; Glendale also wants to go say hi whenever he sees other calm dogs and could go home with a well-matched doggie sibling. This sweet guy is full of love and he&#039;s sure to make some lucky family very happy. Come meet him!"

Our Dodge is that very mellow guy! He loves walking on a leash and is easily handled by our Junior Volunteers. Impressive because he&#039;s so big. 81 pounds big. He&#039;s seven years old and over the puppy crazies. Dodge isn&#039;t treat driven, and a tickle behind the ear works just as well for a reward. So far he&#039;s been non-reactive to all the other animals at the shelter.

Dogs are very social animals; there&#039;s really no such thing as a &quot;good outdoor dog&quot;.\n\nIf Dodge would be the second dog in your family, give us a call and schedule a Meet and Greet under supervision at our shelter with your spayed or neutered dog. 830-980-2247 or BAHShelter@yahoo.com.\n\nYou can visit with Dodge and all of the adoptable animals at BAHS on Tues\/Thurs\/Sat from 10A to 1P or during &quot;Special Adoption&quot; hours on Sunday from 1P to 4P.

Vincent Van Gogh&#039;s famous painting is eulogized in this popular 80&#039;s song by Don McClean!!  Starry, starry night perfectly describes my beautiful coat which shows similar swirls, textures, and color palette to the famous painting.  Hence, my namesake!!\n\nI am a hybrid of two amazing working dog breeds; Australian Cattle Dog and a guarding breed that results in double dew claws on my back legs.  But, as a hybrid,  I don&#039;t run on petrol and electric, I run on milk bones, hot dogs, and snuggles!!  With this hairytage of brainiac working dawgs, just imagine the smarts in my noggin!!   My luxurious &quot;Starry Night&quot; coat has the merle effect \nassociated with my Heeler Hariytage, but I am taller and have double dew  claws on my back feet (Livestock Guardian breeding!)  I will probably top out at a lean 50 pounds when at my ideal weight.\n\nFoster Mum calls me an absolute &quot;DOLL&quot;!!  I don&#039;t want to embarrass my nice Foster Mum, but I am a walking breathing canine, not a DOLL!!\n\nI am a loyal, confident and trustworthy four legged family dog that loves being inside and outside with his family.  I am equally happy lounging on the couch, going on action adventure hikes, or leisurely strolls to the coffee house.  I am very respectful of my hooman and walk gently on the leash without pulling too much. I walk best in a no pull harness.\n\nI am eager to please my hooman and strive not to cause any discomfort, frustration, or extra work.  I am crate trained and will only bark when crated if I have to &quot;go&quot;.\n\nI am playful and athletic and do well with other social dogs.  Foster mum even introduced me to her most fearful foster and I wagged my tail, licked his nose and went about my business.\n\nMy favorite thing is belly rubs...wait, no, my favorite thing has to be going on walks...or maybe it&#039;s treat time?  Can I possibly have three favorite things?  I will have to ask Foster mum about that!!  Let me also add, I love to give kissess!!  I could probably make a good living working at a kissing booth...and love every minute of it!\n\nFoster mum calls me a &quot;quick study&quot; (Hoomans and their crazy  sayings...Sheesh!!)  Sometimes, it is hard to remember which is my  actual name!! As previously mentioned, I am eager to please learn very quickly.\n\nI REALLY enjoy being a part of the family and being included in activities.  At 45\npounds, I am the perfect size to be able to tag along with you anywhere you go, and my striking good looks are an artist&#039;s dream :)\n\nAnother chorus of Don McLean&#039;s ditty describes my life with my original owners who\nhad to give me up; (please excuse my literary license with the lyrics)\n\n&quot;For they could not love me\nBut still my love was true\nAnd when no hope was left inside&quot;............

She&#039;s just getting used to how this whole beloved family dog thing works, but she definitely likes the sleeping indoors on a soft bed part of the deal. She&#039;s still figuring out how to walk on leash and doesn&#039;t quite know what to do with toys, but she&#039;s already developed an affinity for Kongs and rawhides and most of all, treats. Although Estelle is shy around people, treats are the way to her heart. She&#039;ll approach you when she wants some attention, and she seems to like the 8 and 10 year-old girls in her foster home. She&#039;s done wonderfully with the resident senior Jack Russell mix - the first time her foster parents saw her tail wag was when she met her new doggie foster brother. She&#039;s also been fine with the resident kitty, not paying him any mind. Estelle is a very chill houseguest, happy to lounge around and keep an eye on what everyone&#039;s up to. She&#039;s perfect when left home alone (just keep those treats up high somewhere), she never barks at strangers or when someone knocks on the door. And she likes being in her crate, especially if there&#039;s a big soft pillow for her to chill on. And we should mention those glorious and scratchable ears that are truly a sight to behold! Gentle, beautiful and quiet, Estelle would make a wonderful addition to any number of loving homes, ideally one another dog to help show her the ropes.

This young boy came to TGPR because a very nice Good Samaritan couple saw this skeletal, sad, mostly bald dog, wander into their neighborhood.  He was so very sweet, but clearly desperately in need of help.  This wonderful young couple did not just call rescue - they put Wilder in their car and took him to the vet, starting his treatment for significant skin infections, fleas, ticks and ear infections.  Thus, when TGPR took him in, Wilder was already starting his road to recovery.   Wilder is currently in a foster home, and is being fed wholesome food, snacks and receiving baths every other day for his skin.   Want to know how Wilder responded to being saved?  Within twenty four hours, this poor guy, so thin every rib and spinal vertebrae were visible, stood on his hind legs and gifted his foster family with the brightest smile.  It was truly a gift and epitomizes his personality.\n\nWilder is not an LGD.  While he loves to go outside, sniff, walk the fence line, like any other member of his breed, he prefers to live inside, with his human present and close.  Wilder gives delicate kisses, and pushes his body against you - his favorite spot is standing right behind your knees and leaning.    \n\nWilder gets along very well with other dogs, and is very playful - he is a puppy.  He has nice dog\/dog manners, and appears to have been socialized in his early weeks of life.  Wilder has not responded negatively to cats walking through the yard or in the veterinarian&#039;s office.  He met children in the vet&#039;s office and was very excited to see them, did not jump.  Basically, everyone is Wilder&#039;s friend.\n\nAre you looking for a Pyr family member?  Well, then look no further than Wilder.   However, since he is still just a puppy - albeit a huge puppy - Wilder needs continued socialization and training.  His foster family has already started his training, including basic commands and leash work.\n\nTexas Great Pyrenees Rescue, Inc. is a 501(c)(3) organization dedicated to Great Pyrenees.

My little brother is a little fiesty but I let him because I am the bigger brother (a whole 1 lb larger). I am more gentle and settle down easier but don&#039;t get me wrong... I can light up like a firecracker, too! I love to chase my foster brother around (he&#039;s scared of me - not sure why? He&#039;s 65 lbs and a old man but I just want to kiss him one time - JUST ONCE!). I&#039;m looking for my forever home... is that with you? Feel free to come play with me, see how soft my belly is and stare into my puppy eyes until I go to sleep. Love, Christopher. I am living in a San Antonio Pets Alive! foster home. By adopting me, you not only give me a new leash on life; you also save the life of an additional pet who can be rescued from euthanasia and placed in foster care. If you are interested in adopting me, please email adopt@sanantoniopetsalive.org with my name and ID#. Please allow up to 24 hours to respond, as all fosters work on a volunteer basis.

Can you feel the calmness and &quot;Zen&quot; of this scene? That is exactly the soothing and calm energy that I emote.\n\nAccording to Wikipedia, the definition of the word Pacific means &quot;peaceful in nature or intent, nonviolent, mild, gentle, and equable&quot;. All of these adjectives describe me perfectly!!\n\nMy hairytage is the working breed dawg of Anatolian Shepard and\nAmerica&#039;s most popular Labrador Retriever\u2026imagine the smarts in my noggin\u2019!This unique mix is a wonderful hybrid that takes many positive personality traits from both its parents.I inherited the calm, nurturing, caretaker vibe from the Livestock Guardian Anatolian Shepard and the sweet and loyal nature from my Labrador genetics.\n\nI am an adorably sweet, 10-month-old spayed female pup. I currently weigh 73 pounds, so will probably top out as an adult around 80-85\npounds or so. I am trim and athletic and LOVE water sports and action\/adventure hikes...but, I also love lounging on the couch in front of a blazing fire to spend some snuggle time with my hooman(s)! Walks around the park or to the local coffee shop are also on my &quot;to do list&quot;!! As long as I am with you :)\n\nI am medium energy, gorgeous gal with a sunny disposition and a positive outlook on life ?I am a soft-furred, genteel lady who takes treats gently, knows sit, come, wait and down.I walk nicely on a leash without tugging (Foster Mum walks me in an &quot;Easy Walker&quot; harness!!). My original owner had me in classes with a professional trainer; the trainer&#039;s comment was that I was very &quot;focused on and connected with my person; eager to please with a lot of potential.&quot;\n\nSpeaking of my original owner, I was surrendered by them because the family&#039;s other dog started aggressively attaching me. The other dog and I were ok when I was a small pup, but, as I grew up, the other dog became more and more aggressive. When an attack on me resulted in a\npuncture wound so deep it required a vet visit and a drain, my original owner brought me to Foster Mum&#039;s ranch for my own safety. There were a lot of tears and much sadness for all of us. Through tears, my original Dad said that I was the best dog that he ever had.\n\nWith my gentle, submissive nature, I get along well with all other dogs (large and small), hoomans, and kidlings.I am playful with the doggies, but also love to snuggle on the couch for some down time. Tug of war is my favorite game! :)I love people and try hard to be a good girl and please my hooman\u2026.you just have to let me know what you want me to do!!(I really try to be a good girl!)\n\nWith my \u201cglass is half full approach\u201d to life, I am ready to find the furever family that I deserve whom I can take care of and share love and adventures!"

So if you want to meet her, you&#039;ll need patience, understanding and a big heart. Initially frightened of every movement and sound, she is still quite ambivalent of strangers and new situations. She&#039;s never been aggressive, just vocal and what some would call skittish. Clara is smart as a whip; she knows sit, lay down, no, this way and right here. She walks great on a leash, until there are people or animals in view. Walks are always an opportunity for training. Clara is house and crate trained...in fact her crate is her safe place, she easily goes in. She loves a comfy dog bed and taking naps. While she plays with the neighbor dogs through the fence on each side, super slow intros face to face are strongly recommended. Her prey drive is high; she is ready to pounce and chase cats, birds and squirrels. Her favorite things are green beans, bully sticks and playing with her toys.

I am named after Hank Henshaw aka Cyborg Superman. I know it&#039;s a reach, but foster mom says my fur and eyes make it look like I am made of many different parts, like a cyborg. I think she should just call me Hank Handsome, but she buys the kibbles around here, so I let it slide.\n\nMy weird colors are due to the fact that I am a Catahoula and Aus Cattle Dog\/Blue Heeler mix. I&#039;m not sure if that makes me a CataCattle Dog, or maybe a Heelahoula? Man, Chiweenies have it easy.\n\nI came to God&#039;s Dogs after someone found me running loose in San Antonio with a hurt leg. I was taken in, treated, and HEELED (haha, get it?) very quickly. I can&#039;t be out of commission very long with all the stuff there is for me to do! Anywho, with as much great work as the people did in finding me, they weren&#039;t able to find my family and needed help in getting me a new one. Maybe that&#039;s where you come in. *wink*\n\nBack to playtime!! I love to bounce bounce bounce bounce, just like the tennis balls I play fetch with. Foster mom says bounce for ball is ok, bounce on people is.....good? Bad? Oh I forget. (He needs some training help but learns quickly.)\n\nIn true Heeler fashion, I am extremely loyal and loving, chock full of energy for lots of activities, but protective over the things that are mine. My food, my toys, my family. I am ok with other dogs, but on top of being protective, I am also a herding dog. I herd EVERYTHING. Tennis balls, bugs, my hair floating in the sun (I shed A LOT). I also love to herd my foster mom&#039;s puppies when they run around the yard. They think I&#039;m being rough, but I&#039;m really just trying to teach them how to act like big boys like me.\n\nInside the house, I do ok, but try to mark here and there. I don&#039;t go potty inside of my crate, but I am still getting used to the concept. Sometimes I cry when I am in there, but not for long because, like I said, I&#039;m a big boy. Foster mom says that I still need to be &quot;noodled&quot; (neutered) or something, too. After I get my noodle, I should not have the urge to mark, and my not be so rambunctious or dominant over the other pups at home.\n\nI am a very smart, sweet, and oh so handsome guy that would love to be your partner in crime....I mean life. Won&#039;t you make me furrever yours?\n\nGOD&#039;S DOGS Rescue, in San Antonio TX, does not have a shelter - Our dogs are raised in foster homes in the San Antonio area. Each dog comes spayed or neutered, up-to-date with age appropriate vaccinations, microchipped, heartworm tested and are current with monthly flea\/tick and heartworm preventatives. \n\nALL OF THIS IS INCLUDED IN THE Local ADOPTION FEE OF $250.00 FOR PUPPIES and $200.00 for ADULTS.

Mary gets incredibly happy whenever she sees her person, and on the occasions she&#039;s being lazy, she will stare at you and move her face as if she was talking to you just by looking at you! Every morning when she hears you wake up, she&#039;ll come running to the bedroom door, super-excited and playful and just so happy that you made it! While Mary can be nervous with new people, once she warms up, she&#039;ll be your best friend forever. Mary is so well-behaved in the home, her fosters say she&#039;s almost human. She&#039;ll follow you around the house while you do your chores, but without getting in your way, just making great company and being an adorable shadow. On top of being crate and house-trained, Mary knows commands like sit, down, stay, pop up and low five. And if you tell her to wait, she will wait in front of her food until you tell her it&#039;s ok to eat. She also previously lived with a pair of kitties and did fine with them. She rides great in the car, sheds very little and comes in the perfect size - not too big, not too little. A great mix of joyful playmate and cuddly couch potato, Mary would do well in a house or apartment and will make a loving and loyal companion to some very lucky person. Come meet this sweet pup!"

I am not a pure bread doggie, but I am wholesome and honey drizzled. I will enrich your life and I am the next best thing to sliced bread. Stop. That is actually all a fib. My name is Wonder, because it is a \u201cwonder\u201d that I am walking after being paralyzed by an altercation with an automobile. Boo hoo right? It is much more fun to pretend I am named after bread. Bread is the backbone of society and deserves a standing ovation.\n\nHistory:\n\nAfter being bunged up by a car, my back-end refused to coopawrate with my front-end and I had to drag my back legs. The City of San Antonio Animal Care services started my rehabuttlitation to get my booty back in business. I went to a God\u2019s Dogs Rescue Foster Home to continue to work on my coordination. Now I walk, but kinda like a drunk uncle, not too straight, a little crooked, but in a cute way.\n\nBreed\/Age\/Weight:\n\nI am about 1.5 years old and a girl doggie.  I am a mostly white colored with a few toasted spots Terrier mix weighing in at 40 pounds.\n\nProblem:\n\nI had 99 problems but being sad ain\u2019t one. Once my back end was rehabuttlitated and I could wag my tooshy again, I had a new problem. I was suffering from Happy Tail Syndrome. It\u2019s like a thing.  And my tail was knocking into stuff real hard, thump THUMP, kerthud, whack, ouch. During a surgery to remove a fluid filled tumor from my left booty cheek, the Vet also removed my tail so I couldn\u2019t hurt it anymore either. Now I have a nub tail to add to my cute factor.\n\nTemperament:\n\nI love to play with other dogs and having a crooked back-end does not stop my roll. My crooked gait isn\u2019t even something other dogs notice. After playing I like to cuddle in the doggie pile and snooze until it is time to play again.  I am described as \u201cdelightful\u201d. I like to be in the same room as my human, but I don\u2019t have to be directly underfoot all the time.\n\nSkills:\n\nI am house and crate trained.  Foster Mom has a small door just for doggies and I use it to go outside when I need to relieve myself.\n\nFinal Ask:\n\nI am a really good dog and don\u2019t even bork, except that one time the other dogs were going litterally nuts over a squirell, of course I joined in and said \u201cbork, bork\u201d just to fit in due to peer pressure.  Otherwise I am quiet and sweet and you will be happy to know me, but not as happy as me, I set the bar the Happy meter.

I\u2019ve been road doggin with my Foster Mom while she travels for work.

I\u2019m about 40 pounds or so and I\u2019m as big as I\u2019m going to get. I love people and even kid people, all people. I know how to SIT on command. Foster Mom says I would be an ideal pawtner for a trucker or police officer or fireman or encyclopedia salesman, because I make the best ride along bud.\n\nBut if you live in a house a lot, I am good with that too. Foster Mom says I\u2019m doing great learning all the rules to being in a house. I am potty trained and will wake you up at night if nature calls, so that I don\u2019t make any uh-ohs in the house. I don\u2019t chew up your stuff, just my toys annnnd sometimes a water bottle, crinkle crinkle, that plastic cronchy is music to my ears.\n\nI live here at my Foster Mom\u2019s house with two little Chihuahuas, oops, I meant Yorkie Pies, or some other big eared small creature.  One of them is called Lil Shyt, because she has pooped more than a few times out of spite. Lucky for you, Lil Shyt already has a permanent home that has loved her for 12 years. I hope I find a home too that will love me for 12 years even if I pooped in their shoe! I won\u2019t do that.  I promise.\n\nI love to go on sniffathons and smell everything.  When I meet new dogs, I like to sniff them too, properly with doggie manners, not jump right into playing. Ironically, even though I LOVE riding in trucks, about the only thing that I am not a fan of is things on wheels like bikes and skateboards.

She knows how this whole &#039;dog&#039; thing works. She will sit, she will be polite in the home, she will go outside to potty, she&#039;ll bark when there are people lurking around outside but she will stop when asked. In return, you will pet her, give her something nice and soft to lay on, cuddle her during thunderstorms and take her for walks. This is the contract. She knows the score. Sasha has been a dream of a houseguest in her foster home, a highly affectionate dog with impeccable manners - she will wiggle with happiness when you get home and then go back to being her calm self. She is very intelligent and eager to please - she will bark when someone comes close to the apartment, but stops as soon as her foster mom tells her it&#039;s okay. She hasn&#039;t yet shown any interest in toys, but she loves her walks and also does her business quickly on brief outings. Sasha is complete house-trained and does great left home alone without getting into any trouble. She has never attempted to reach the kitchen counters or any form of food sneaking. She&#039;s well-behaved on walks and will sit when you pick up her leash. She loves to cuddles and to be petted, but isn&#039;t pushy about it and understands when that time is over and is happy to go chill on her bed. She is courteous with strangers and happy to get their pets. Sasha would make a wonderful addition to any number of loving homes with people who will give her plenty of attention and ideally one with a yard to romp in. In return she promises to love you forever. Come meet this perfect pup!"

As a TOP dog, Turkey has a personalized training plan and works with a volunteer trainer several times a week to help him learn the skills to become the best dog he can be! Turkey is learning skills like sit and down, walking nicely on leash, sitting calmly when approached by strangers or other dogs, staying in a sit or down until told &#039;free,&#039; coming when called and &#039;place&#039;, which means he\/she will go to a specific place in your home on command. Once Turkey successfully completes all the skills on his training plan, he will be considered TOP Dog Ready! Turkey is working hard to become a wonderful companion, and as a part of APA&#039;s Total Obedience Program you can work with APA staff to continue to build a training relationship with Turkey after adoption and master all the TOP dog skills together.

Maple can walk up the stairs to the second floor of her foster home, but she&#039;s still trying to figure out the going down part. But she&#039;s got the squirrel thing down already. Maple has a hilarious obsession with squirrel watching, and she likes nothing more than being out in the backyard, keeping an eye on them and chasing them when they&#039;re up to no good. After five days in her foster home, Maple figured out what toys are for, and now her favorite pastime (besides squirrel-hunting) is throwing her purple squeaky bunny in the air and play bowing to it. She also likes to be where the people are and will follow them around the house like an adorable shadow. She loves back and ear scratches and mostly prefers to lay in her bed next to where you are sitting, but will occasionally rub her face and body against you like a cat. Maple has been great with with the 4 and 8 year-olds kid in her foster home and is very gentle with them, though she seems to prefer the chiller energy of the older one. She&#039;s also calm around the resident kitties, mostly ignoring them. While she likes her walks and chasing squirrels in the back yard, she has a low to medium energy level and takes several long naps during the day. Maple is house-trained and fantastic on her leash. She responds well to &#039;leave it and comes when you call her. She is crated during the day, and while she&#039;s not crazy about it, she settles down after a bit. She does fine being left out at night and will happily sleep in her dog bed next to her foster parents. Maple would thrive in a loving home with people who will help her build her confidence as she continues to blossom into her playful and happy self. She loves walks and loves her people, and as long as she has that and a good squirrel-watching spot, Maple will be one happy camper. Come meet this sweet girl!"

With her regal beauty and gorgeous coat, Pumpkin is truly a one-of-a-kind dog. She&#039;s highly intelligent, eager to learn and always wants to please her people. She&#039;s house and crate-trained, walks well on leash, is very well-behaved in the home and knows a ton of commands. While she&#039;s a total cuddle bug who likes to give kisses and definitely thinks she&#039;s a lap dog, she also respectful her person&#039;s space. Pumpkin is a pretty active pup and loves to go jogging with her foster&#039;s teenage son. She enjoys hiking and jumps in the lake, but can also chill and watch a basketball game with you. And you cannot throw the ball enough with Pumpkin. She LOVES playing fetch, and when your arm is finally tired, she&#039;ll keep it going by tossing her toys to herself! She&#039;s also great with dogs and lives with two in her foster home, a senior and a younger pittie who she loves to play with. She&#039;s also great with cats and is BFF with the resident kitty. Silly, affectionate, well-behaved and just a delight to have around the house, Pumpkin would make a wonderful addition to any number of loving homes. She&#039;d love a yard or at least an outdoorsy family who can take her on long walks or hikes and include her in their adventures. And of course someone who likes to get lots of hugs and kisses. If that sounds like yours, come meet Pumpkin!"

My name is Grace and I am beautiful white German Shepherd with gray peppered markings on my back.  Everyone thinks I am about six years old, but six must be the new three, because I feel like a puppy!  I am in the best shape of my life and I haven&#039;t had any medical concerns.  I love being active and going on walks, road trips, hiking, and swimming, but I also like being a couch potato and watching my favorite animal planet shows!  If there is an animal of any kind on TV, count me in to watch it right beside you.  I like to be a part of everything that goes on, treated like a very important member of the family.  When I had my own family, I lived in the house, slept on my own special bed, and learned to be a good friend and companion.  I am (of course!) house broken and crate trained, I am an awesome leash walker, and I know a handful of playful tricks (sit, stand, lie down, shake, high-five, and &quot;bang&quot;) that made my family happy.  I am well behaved when left alone during the day and my family didn&#039;t put me my crate during the day while they were at work because I was very good. I love hanging around older kids and adults but tend to be pretty clunky around babies and toddlers.  Sometimes I don\u2019t know my own strength, or how hard my tail flaps back and forth!  It takes me some time to become acquainted with other dogs and I&#039;m a bit anxious in dog park settings. However, I shared my home and family with another dog and we got along great, but I&#039;ve always had a secret wish to be an only dog.   As for cats, well, I&#039;m really not a big fan.  I would really love to find a new family to call my own, I&#039;m loyal and beautiful and happy, and I have a lot of love to share.  Maybe you could be my new forever friend?\n\nFill out an application today if you feel like I would be a great fit in your home!\n\n&lt;p&gt;Please visit &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;http:\/\/www.austingermanshepherdrescue.org&quot;&quot;&gt;Austin German Shepherd Rescue&lt;\/a&gt; for more information on this pet!&lt;\/p&gt;"	"https:\/\/dl5zpyw5k3jeb.cloudfront.net\/photos\/pets\/44359128\/1\/?bust=1554067705"	"https:\/\/dl5zpyw5k3jeb.cloudfront.net\/photos\/pets\/44359128\/1\/?bust=1554067705","https:\/\/dl5zpyw5k3jeb.cloudfront.net\/photos\/pets\/44359128\/2\/?bust=1554067714","https:\/\/dl5zpyw5k3jeb.cloudfront.net\/photos\/pets\/44359128\/3\/?bust=1554067716","https:\/\/dl5zpyw5k3jeb.cloudfront.net\/photos\/pets\/44359128\/4\/?bust=1554067725"	"adoptable"	"House trained","Spay\/Neuter","Shots Current"	null	null	true	false	null	null	false	Austin German Shepherd Rescue	not-adopted

Her foster dad says she is doing great with house training and has figured out the doggie door as well.  She is currently being fostered with another small dog and does great with him.  Greta would love to find a home that will let her snuggle in bed with the humans and also on the couch while watching tv.\n\nGreta is a miniature schnauzer that is estimated to be 5 years old and weighs 12 pounds.  She is being spayed this week and then we will be getting her dental done in a couple of week.

I get along really well with everyone I have met, dogs big or small, cats and all humans. I just had my teeth cleaned, I lost a few that were really hurting me, now I am starting to feel much better. I absolutely love nothing more than a comfy bed, a blanket to burrow under and to be near my humans. I discovered the big bed and don\u2019t ever want to leave it, its so soft and warm !\n\nI am very quiet, a little bit shy and reserved, quite inquisitive and a huge love bug. My foster Mom says I look into your soul. I am learning how to live in a home and am loving every minute of it. I am still recovering from my dental work and am learning to be a part of a small pack. They are teaching me to be a regular dog that does dog things.\n\nI would be so happy to have my own family that could be patient with me as I learn and grow into a very special boy.\n\nChuck Es in loooove, he\u2019s in love, he\u2019s in love\u2026 won\u2019t you love him back and give him a forever home ?\n\nLove dachshunds and not ready to adopt or circumstances won&#039;t permit having a dog?

We don&#039;t know her back story but we do know she is sweet and timid. A very polite girl and when nervous or unsure she will check in with her human and try to avoid the thing that is making her uncomfortable. Once she is comfortable with you she solicits pets and leans in for all the extra loving. We would suggest a family with older children. She&#039;s lived with big dogs in a previous foster home but we would still suggest a meet and greet with any other dogs. She&#039;s a bit unsure about cats. Slow introductions all around.\nShe is crate trained, food motivated, takes treats with a soft mouth, working on house training and rides well in the car.

As much as he enjoys his playtime, he&#039;s quite content to settle down for snuggles with his humans. Lucio is also thriving in APA!&#039;s Total Obedience Program (TOP), which is modeled after the AKC&#039;s Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test. As a TOP dog, Lucio has a personalized training plan and works with a volunteer trainer several times a week to help him learn the skills to become the best dog he can be! He is learning skills like down, walking nicely on leash, sitting calmly when approached by strangers or other dogs, staying in a sit or down until told &#039;free,&#039; coming when called and &#039;Place&#039;, which means he will go to a specific place in your home on command. Lucio is working hard to become a wonderful companion, and as a part of APA&#039;s Total Obedience Program you can work with APA staff to continue to build a training relationship with him after adoption and master all the TOP dog skills together. Check out a video on APA&#039;s CGC program, on which the TOP was based: https:\/\/vimeo.com\/89434193 Lucio is hoping for a home with someone who will play with him and take him for walks, but also make time for those snuggles. A yard where he can play fetch would be ideal. Come meet this perfect pup!"

Eat, potty, nap and repeat - and he&#039;s very appreciative of you sticking to that schedule, thank you, specifically the eating three times a day with snacks thrown in as well. Bertram would make a wonderful Hobbit. He loves being outdoors, wandering around and happily sniffing the yard and garden. But only food seems to get Bertram truly excited, and he always gives a little jump when he senses his food bowl is coming. As independent as he is, Bertram is attentive to where his person is and follows them from room to room, hoping to find a dog bed in each one. He&#039;s fine with all dogs and wags his tail when a new one comes on the scene. He&#039;s lived with two chihuahuas and has had lots of doggie visitors in the yard - Bertram likes to sniff them and wag his tail, but after he&#039;s said his hellos, he&#039;s happy to get back to exploring the garden. Bertram is deaf and sort of blind, but he learned his way around his foster&#039;s home fairly quickly. He&#039;s crate-trained and is perfectly content to sleep in his crate through the night and also when left home alone. He&#039;s a quiet fella to have around and doesn&#039;t get into any trouble. In fact, he&#039;s only ever barked once and that was to greet another dog. Dignified and plucky, Bertram wants nothing more than to be loved and kept on a predictable routine. An outdoor space to explore would be wonderful, and in return he promises to be quiet and non-demanding, a low-key companion just looking to celebrate his retirement. Come meet him!"

Champ does well with other dogs, but due to his size and potential roughness, smaller dogs are not recommended. He loves children, but again, he is not really aware of his size so more mature children would be best. Champ just wants to bond to his person and be treated like a family member! He is healthy except for bad knees: he had a knee replacement and the vet said odds are his other back knee will need replacing so no rowdy running and jumping for Champ. He enjoys playing, but luckily he is not excessively rowdy. Leashed exercise walks are highly recommended.\n\n- IMPORTANT INFORMATION -\n\nSASPCA Homeward Bound Dog Rescue and San Antonio Great Dane Rescue are 501(c)(3) foster-based rescue groups based in San Antonio, Texas.\n\nOur group focuses on assisting open admission shelters in South Texas where over 32,000 dogs and cats are euthanized each year.Our puppies and dogs are completely vetted and live in foster homes.

Shrugs recently lost one of his legs, but even just a few days after surgery, he treated it like a minor inconvenience. He&#039;s got too many dogs and people to meet to worry about all that! Shrugs gets so excited to see new people that he breaks out in a big smile and his tail goes absolutely crazy. He&#039;s still figuring out his balance with the three legs, so he sometimes gets so excited that he almost falls over. But when he sees an unattended sandwich on the table, he might as well have six legs... Whoosh! There goes Shrugs! Shrugs loves to be loved on and leans into you for pets. He nudges your hand if you stop, and he also gives kisses and hugs. He&#039;s great with dogs and was so excited to meet the resident Lab in his foster home. He walks wonderfully on leash and loves all the dogs he passes on the street. While he stays calm, that tail just starts wagging whenever he sees one coming. He also loves to watch TV and his tail wags when he sees people on the screen. Shrugs is overall a pretty chill dog to have around. He&#039;s house-trained and listens well, doesn&#039;t jump on people and takes treats very gently. He is a smart boy who quickly picked up on the rules of the house, and he&#039;s food-motivated so training should be easy. He likes to follow his people around the house, but will happily go lay on his bed if you have people things to do. Shrugs would make a wonderful addition to any number of loving homes, and he&#039;s going to make some lucky family very happy. Come meet him!"

His two favorite things are cuddles and toys. He is potty trained and crate trained and has had no accidents even when I have had long days away (8-9 hours). He is very smart and a quick learner who is treat motivated so he is already sitting for treats, learning sit, down and stay as well. He loves walks and does well on leash. He gets excited to see other people and dogs but does not show any aggresive behavior, just excitement and interest. He is still a bit of a puppy and does some jumping up, chewing and mouthing hands, etc but has improved a lot just in the time I have had him.  His other great attributes are that he is not a barker and is VERY people friendly. He loves getting pets and belly rubs and will give you lots of licks in return if you let him. He will make his new owners very to happy to have such a loving guy in the home."

I am really enjoying my new life now that I have had all my dental work done! At first, I was very timid and scared of my own shadow, but I have warmed up to my new foster home and I greet everyone with a wagging tail.\n\nMy foster parents have a cat, he likes to pick on me, but I just ignore him, but I get along great the other dogs in the house. I am potty trained, and\nlove having a yard to run around in. I love to cuddle. I will sit with you on your bed, couch, or any other place that I can be next to you while you read or binge watch Netflix. I don\u2019t understand the leash and harness thing very well, but I am sure given time I can learn to walk well on it.\n\nI can\u2019t wait to find that perfect family to call home, and if you have children, I am ok with that as long as they give me their laps to sit in too! I look forward to meeting you and licking your face!\n\nLove,\nBear\nLove dachshunds and not ready to adopt or circumstances won&#039;t permit having a dog?

He\u2019s submissive and adores belly rubs. There are strong signs he may be house trained. He walks great on a leash and is heartworm negative. On the surface, he seems afraid of other larger dogs. This awesome fella would likely fit well into any relatively calm family. He also is curious and enjoys chasing squirrels for fun. ;) Webster has been playing with other dogs, female mostly, so there is a good chance he is fine with a dog you already have.

She enjoys napping throughout the day, and while she doesn&#039;t need a great deal of activity, she does like going on short walks, taking in the fresh air and feeling the breeze.

Despite being dumped, she knew to ask for help from a human. So quick to forgive!! \nShe is around 2 years and weighing in at 49 pounds. Absolutely loves going for long walks to sniff and explore. Car rides are the best, or is it toys and chew bones? It\u2019s her mission in life to say hi to every human out there. Dogs too, seems to prefer males over females. Cats and squirrels are boring!! \n\nPolitely will ask to go outside to go potty. Doesn\u2019t mind going into a crate for safe keeping while nobody is home. She still has a little bit of puppy tendencies with collecting and chewing things. Ms. Annie is looking for a human(s) who are kind, caring, loving, fun and firm. Pssssst....she can be on the stubborn side at times. Will it be you to give her, her furever home?  \n\nAnnie is spayed and vaccinated. Her adoption fee is $75.

He was a champ during all the treatments and being crated a lot, so some long walks will do him good! His foster parents have been taking it easy with him while he heals. but Frijoles will play with ANYTHING given the chance (toys by himself, other dogs, people). He has so much energy, as he is still a puppy at heart with 100% of his mind dedicated to squeaky balls, ropes, etc. He&#039;s still working on his manners as he&#039;s just so excited when he gets to meet new people, and his whole butt wiggles as he knocks stuff over. It&#039;s hard to really cuddle Frijoles at the moment because of the cone, but he will push that smooshable face right into yours and he loves having his ears scratched. He currently lives with a couple of Saint Bernards and a pittie, and he gets along with all of them. He also walks great on a leash, is house and crate-trained and will go in his crate on command. Playful, sweet, energetic and resilient, Frijoles is looking for a home with a yard and an active family who will include him their adventures and give him plenty of attention.

Find a few whose personality seems to fit well. Consider one of our Well Seasoned Seniors who are truly wonderful and have so much to offer. Need help finding the best fit? We&#039;ll help with that too. Please fill out an application and let\u2019s get you all matched up with a loving new \u201cfurever\u2019 companion and friend. You\u2019ll find the application on the \u201cAvailable Dogs\u201d page.\nNOTE:\n\nAdoptions to Texas residents only\n\n.\n\nStandard Adoption Fee Adult Dog: $250 ea. Puppy Adoption Fee: $300 ea. Reduced rates for Seniors dogs (10 and up). Reduced rates for pairs (when adopted together).\n\nEmail: ddrtxinfo@gmail.com Primary Website: www.DDRTX.org\nLight Heartworm Positive ContractPablo is a young 13.1\/2 lb. dapple, although he appears more like a red dachshund. He has a light dusting of beige hair on his sides and almost a black strip down his back. He has one beautiful white spot on the side of his neck. But while his muted markings do not make a huge fashion statement his unusually calm and gentle nature makes him truly unique at his young age.\n\nPablo is still growing his personality and his foster family is making new discoveries every day. He loves to be pet, and when you stop he will nudge for more. He likes being in a lap or lying near his human. He likes toys and has a gentle way of playing. He loves lying in the sun or adventuring outside chasing squirrels with the other foster dogs in the house. He will take treats in a very sweet mannerly way.\n\nHe is housetrained and has accepted being in a kennel but prefers to sleep in the bed with the other foster dogs.\n\nHe gets along well with all adults and the other dogs in the house but may need to be around only older children. He can be a little protective of his food at feeding time, but his Foster mom is working on his trust through this and he is showing signs of improvement.\n\nPablo is most definitely very sweet, gentle and quiet with an angelic look out his eyes. The right family will need to give him time to adjust to yet another change in his life, but we are confident he will accept new surroundings in the same way he has in the foster\u2019s home. There is a future lifetime of love to have from this little guy.\n\nPUPDATE: Pablo has tested light heartworm positive. He is available for adoption under a heartworm positive contract.\nLove dachshunds and not ready to adopt or circumstances won&#039;t permit having a dog?

44463682	709.6534142512737	"Boston Terrier"	"null"	false	"Brindle"	"Senior"	"Female"	"Small"	"Short"	"Grace"	"Grace is an approximately 10-11 year old Boston Terrier. She weighs about 17 pounds. Grace appears to have had a rough life and has been dealt some difficult cards. Despite this, she is the sweetest little girl in search of her perfect furever.\n\nShe came to us from a shelter \u2014 she was microchipped but the owner did not come for her. She has a very wobbly\/strange gait but gets around pretty well. She can\u2019t do stairs or jump on\/off furniture, but she can run around, and she loves to roll in the grass. She definitely has a sense of humor.\n\nWe aren\u2019t sure what causes her gait issue, one thought was maybe a disc issue in her past but we have no true diagnosis for this \u2014 but she did not give the vet any indication of it being an active injury or painful. We think due to her very shortened toenails (from rubbing the ground) &amp; confidence in her walk (even with the sometimes falls) that she has had this gait for quite a while as well. What we do know from her labs and abdominal ultrasound is that sweet Grace has been living with liver tumors for probably quite awhile. One is very large. Without surgical intervention\/biopsy, the guess is that they are likely benign or low malignancy because they are not fluid filled or interesting in appearance, and if they were anything very aggressive then Grace would likely not be near as happy and functional as she is.  We will definitely provide her lab work and radiologist report to an adopter should they want to go further with exploring diagnostics for her liver.\n\nWe have no way of knowing how long Grace has left, and if she doesn\u2019t have long then we want to prioritize her happiness and comfort over diagnostics and surgeries while she\u2019s in foster care. Our vet has reassured us that this is a valid route to pursue since we know nothing about her history other than she is an older gal with some big struggles going on BUT she is happy and not in pain and LOVES to eat, so we want to focus on that. She could very well be a hospice adoption, but we don\u2019t know that for sure. \n\nShe has had a very generous donor sponsor her adoption fee in hopes that we can find her the perfect home for her golden age. We ask that an adopter be prepared of course that Grace may not have a lot of time left although we really hope that she does! Also, she has some other minor things that could need to be addressed down the line should she have a bit of time left. These include a possibly a dental at some point and a very minor BB size mammary tumor removed (and monitored for growth in the meantime). We don\u2019t want to anesthetize her unless it\u2019s urgent due to her compromised liver, but we want to make an adopter aware of these things. She also is on proin for sleep (pee) Incontinence and hasn\u2019t been having any more accidents since she started this medicine! This would be something an adopter will likely want to continue \u2014 it\u2019s not an expensive medicine and very commonly prescribed to seniors.\n\nGrace is dog &amp; cat friendly. She is potty trained but she needs to go out for pee breaks pretty often or she will have an accident. This is because she drinks a bit of water due to her liver. She does know how to use a doggy door to let herself out to pee.\n\nWe know it seems like a lot to take on, but we really believe that Grace\u2019s guardian angel is out there. If you think you are that home for her, please read the adoption requirements and apply to meet her at www.texassweetiesdogrescue.org . She is spayed, up to date on vaccines, heartworm negative, and microchipped.\n\n"	"https:\/\/dl5zpyw5k3jeb.cloudfront.net\/photos\/pets\/44463682\/3\/?bust=1555275573"	"https:\/\/dl5zpyw5k3jeb.cloudfront.net\/photos\/pets\/44463682\/3\/?bust=1555275573","https:\/\/dl5zpyw5k3jeb.cloudfront.net\/photos\/pets\/44463682\/1\/?bust=1555275554","https:\/\/dl5zpyw5k3jeb.cloudfront.net\/photos\/pets\/44463682\/2\/?bust=1555275569"	"adoptable"	"Spay\/Neuter","Special needs","Shots Current"	null	true	true	true	null	null	false	Texas Sweeties Dog Rescue	adopted

She loves to cuddle and chew on antlers. Her favorite things include playing outside, eating and taking naps.

She walks well on leash but can be hesitant in new environments. She plays well with other dogs and does well with kids, too.\n\nMamma is about 5 years old. She got that name because she was rescued with puppies. Those pups have been adopted and now it&#039;s her turn! She is spayed, vaccinated and microchipped. When first rescued, she tested positive for heartworms. However she&#039;s been treated and is now heartworm free and taking prevention.\n\nThanks for considering a dog from Texas Cattle Dog Rescue! We place heelers all over the state of Texas.\n\nIf you&#039;re interested in one of our dogs, please first complete our adoption application. You can download it at www.texascattledogrescue.com\/adopt.html. Our standard adoption fee is $250 for adult dogs, $300 for puppies. Our dogs will be spayed or neutered, vaccinated and heartworm tested before going to a new home. We conduct a home visit to help match up the right dog with the right owner.

Here&#039;s what T-Bone&#039;s mom had to say about him!: &quot;This is T-Bone - a 4.5 year old Bloodhound\/Rottweiler mix, who weighs approx. 95 pounds. Like most dogs, his favorite things include playing with the same toy for hours (a black rubber Kong), going for rides, playing fetch until he simply can&#039;t anymore, and carrying his favorite stuffies around the house gingerly. T-Bone is also obsessed with cardboard boxes and likes to carry them around and shred them. (He even opens his own Christmas gifts.) He&#039;s also a big fan of the dog park (even without other dogs in it) and hanging out at the brewery with people, kids, and dogs to meet. T-Bone also loves baths and will even ask you for one! He is very smart and trainable and while he knows sit, stay, and down, he was also trained to open the refrigerator (with a pull rope) and to retrieve medications for his chronically ill owner. He is eager to learn and loves to show off. I joke that T-Bone is on his first pass at Earth - he&#039;s never lived any other lives and so everything is a new experience to him. He&#039;s always excited, happy, and full of joy. I&#039;ve actually never met a more loving dog. Despite being a big guy, he loves to cuddle. He is great with other dogs and isn&#039;t cat aggressive but hasn&#039;t spent much time with them. He also loves children but is big and all muscle so maybe not the best choice for tiny children. He is crate trained and sleeps in his crate at night but would love nothing more than to be in bed with you.&quot;"	"https:\/\/dl5zpyw5k3jeb.cloudfront.net\/photos\/pets\/44473456\/1\/?bust=1555530093"	"https:\/\/dl5zpyw5k3jeb.cloudfront.net\/photos\/pets\/44473456\/1\/?bust=1555530093","https:\/\/dl5zpyw5k3jeb.cloudfront.net\/photos\/pets\/44473456\/2\/?bust=1555703332","https:\/\/dl5zpyw5k3jeb.cloudfront.net\/photos\/pets\/44473456\/3\/?bust=1555703334"	"adoptable"	"Spay\/Neuter","Shots Current"	null	null	null	null	null	null	false	PAWS Shelter of Central Texas	not-adopted

She&#039;s been through some tough times in her past life, which resulted in a leg amputation, but after being showered with love and attention in her foster home, she&#039;s become a whole new dog. That missing leg doesn&#039;t slow her down at all, she really enjoys her walks through the neighborhood, and she can jump up on the couch all by herself! When you come through the door, Xena gets so excited to see you that her whole body wiggles, then she runs to get her favorite toy to show it to you. Xena LOVES her squeaky toys. She has a favorite that&#039;s a squeaky avocado, and when she hears it squeak, she will wake from a dead sleep with ears fully perked. True to her name, Xena has been an absolute princess in her foster home, and her affectionate morning nuzzles are a wonderful start to the day. She gets super excited to see you wake up and does a nuzzling thing in your face while pressing her body on top of you with her butt sticking up in the air. Those eyes will melt your soul and that tail will tell you everything you need to know. There&#039;s so much love in her eyes that her foster mom says she can hardly stand it. Xena is protective of those that she loves and will let you know if she hears something outside, but she warms up quickly to new people once she knows they&#039;re supposed to be there. After initially meeting someone and they sit down, Xena&#039;s ready to be their best friend and snuggle. She also does wonderfully with her foster&#039;s 7 year-old male boxer and may be able to live with a well-matched doggie sibling who will let her be the boss. She loves to play and tries to get the resident pup dog to rough house with her, but he&#039;s never been into all that. Despite her impressive strength, Xena is an incredibly gentle girl. She is very careful when taking treats and giving kisses, and even though she is so excited about walks, she patiently waits for her harness to be put on at the door. She does well left home alone and waits to get up for food until it&#039;s put down and you call for her. An absolute gem of a dog, Xena would make a wonderful addition to any number of loving homes. Come meet this sweet girl!"

But she&#039;s also just as happy playing fetch. She&#039;s a real pro who especially loves catching tennis balls, but isn&#039;t picky about toys. She&#039;ll fetch anything you&#039;re willing to throw. A smart pup, Maggie&#039;s learning to obey basic commands and walk well on leash. Because she has so much energy, a home with a big back yard, or even a ranch with a pasture to run, would be a bonus.

He even handles the stairs well. Sammy also has some incontinence issues, and it is unknown if it is related to his legs, but in the meantime a belly band has solved this issue for his foster mom, and he does not mind them at all! Sammy is great with dogs and people so far, and the vets were impressed with how well he handled being examined. He is a very happy, well-behaved puppy, he understands &#039;no&#039; and respects the space of his grumpy foster sisters. Sammy is also great in the car - he lays in a dog bed in the car and passes out for most of the ride. Sammy loves to carry around a tennis ball in his mouth and is content to play with the ball by himself, though he is also not opposed to you throwing it for him every now and then. Sammy also loves his kennel and happily sleeps in it on a nice soft bed. Sammy loves belly rubs, your undivided attention and laying next to his foster mom wherever she is in the house.

He is so full of affection and can&#039;t wait to meet his forever family! Howard is an energy matcher - if you&#039;re excited, he&#039;s excited, if you&#039;re relaxed, he is too. He absolutely loves to romp around the yard and get you outside to play with him, but if it&#039;s time to chill, he&#039;s down for that too. Howard is a bit shy when he first meets new people, but once you&#039;ve won him over, you have a friend for life! This well-behaved pup is house-trained, crate-trained, and has learned &#039;sit&#039; and &#039;down&#039;. He walks wonderfully on leash and is a big fan of trails! This quick learner and really aims to please his people and has excelled in APA!&#039;s Total Obedience Program. The Total Obedience Program (TOP) is modeled after the AKC&#039;s Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test. As a TOP Dog, Howard has a personalized training plan and works with a volunteer trainer several times a week to help him learn the skills to become the best dog he can be! Howard is now TOP Dog Ready, which means he has already learned all the skills in his training plan, including walking nicely on leash, sitting calmly when approached by strangers, calmly walking past another dog, staying in a sit or down until told &#039;free,&#039; and coming when called. Howard has worked hard to become a wonderful companion, and as a part of APA&#039;s Total Obedience Program you can work with APA staff to continue to build a training relationship with Howard after adoption and master all the TOP dog skills together. Check out a video on APA&#039;s CGC program, on which the TOP was based: https:\/\/vimeo.com\/89434193 Howard would love to be a part of a home that loves activity! He has lots of energy and loves long walks and getting plenty of exercise. He mostly just wants lots of love and can&#039;t wait to meet his forever family!

He has not had any training or vet care, but we will provide that and also get him neutered prior to adoption.\n\nIf you would like to give Rafe a good loving home, please go to our website and fill out the adoption application.  Please fill out the application on a PC or a laptop, but it will not submit if you do it on your smart phone."

She is housetrained but needs support to find the door at first since her vision is limited. Her peripheral vision is better but mature cataracts prevent her from seeing directly in front. She appreciated a well lighted environment. She knows how to use a doggie door. \n\nShe loves to dance in the mornings to celebrate every new day, loves men, loves napping in the sun. Her hearing was damaged by untreated ear infections (in her previous life) so she sleeps that wonderful, uninterrupted and deep sleep we all wish we could experience. While her ears are better now, she will need some veterinary oversight to ensure continued improvement. \n\nSarah would love to chase a cat, if they would just stand still! Otherwise, she will cuddle up with them. She enjoys the company of her foster sisters, Emmy Lou and Flossie, and loves evenings when her people settle to watch a movie. \n\nSarah is about 10 years old and is a perfect companion."

I like to think its short for Umbrella because I block metafurically rainy days with my wide happy spirit. I know my face has your typical Boxer look of concern, but that&#039;s just my face, I&#039;m happy happy. My mutto is &quot;I do zoomies to chase away the gloomies&quot;.\n\nI am 12 weeks and 22 lbs, so I&#039;m on my way to be a med\/large girl. My fur Mom is Boxer, this we know. We have no clue on dad, but my paperwork says Lab mix, but let&#039;s face it, some people are gonna also identify me as a Pitbull mix too. So really, I&#039;m a mix of the top 3 goofiest dogs on the planet. Triple non threat. A banana split, a win win win.\n\nI do have a few questions for you, my pawtential adopter. Do you drool? Do you snore? I like to sleep next to my Humans face at sleepy time and it&#039;s non-goatsbull (Note: she means nonnegotiable). Snores and drools aren&#039;t deal breakers, I just want to know ahead of time because you know so much about me now.\n\nI&#039;m a great multi tasker. I can hold a toy in my mouth while running the zooms in the room. Equal to a human chewing gum and walking, now that takes talent! I am good with all dogs, working on potty training, and spayed, got my shots, blah, blah, blah boring stuff people want to know. Final ask, I don&#039;t like to dine alone, so will you sit with me while I gobble my vittles? It&#039;s also like non-goatsbull and stuff. Love you already!\n\nElla is available for adoption with Saving Grace Dog Rescue of San Antonio. The adoption fee is $150.00. An adoption application, home visit and adoption contract are all required. All dogs are spayed\/neutered, up to date on vaccinations appropriate for their age, microchipped, and wormed for internal and external parasites. If you would like more information or an adoption application, please email us at sgdrsa@outlook.com.\n\nPlease note that visual breed identification in rescue dogs is unreliable so for most of our dogs we are only GUESSING at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each dog as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our dogs based on personality, not by breed label.\n\n"	"https:\/\/dl5zpyw5k3jeb.cloudfront.net\/photos\/pets\/44496344\/1\/?bust=1555634168"	"https:\/\/dl5zpyw5k3jeb.cloudfront.net\/photos\/pets\/44496344\/1\/?bust=1555634168","https:\/\/dl5zpyw5k3jeb.cloudfront.net\/photos\/pets\/44496344\/2\/?bust=1555634168","https:\/\/dl5zpyw5k3jeb.cloudfront.net\/photos\/pets\/44496344\/3\/?bust=1555634169","https:\/\/dl5zpyw5k3jeb.cloudfront.net\/photos\/pets\/44496344\/4\/?bust=1555701101","https:\/\/dl5zpyw5k3jeb.cloudfront.net\/photos\/pets\/44496344\/5\/?bust=1555701103","https:\/\/dl5zpyw5k3jeb.cloudfront.net\/photos\/pets\/44496344\/6\/?bust=1555701103"	"adoptable"	"Spay\/Neuter","Shots Current"	null	null	null	null	null	null	false	Saving Grace Dog Rescue of San Antonio	adopted

We have been through dog training sessions. She needs a home with a fenced-in backyard so that she can run and play. She is shy around big dogs, but loves small dogs (she weighs around 12 lbs). She is very shy around children, so a household with small children would not work for her. She is tan with highlighted hair that is soft to the to the touch. She is a a gentle snuggler. On the other hand, she can play hard too.. I work from home, and don&#039;t have a fenced-in backyard. I am rehoming her because I believe she deserves a home with more activity, which would look like a home with 2-4 people\/pets. Kahlua has been spayed, chipped and her vaccinations are all up-to-date.

The puppies have gone on to their forever homes, and now Rosie is looking for one of her own. Rosana has the long body and short legs of a Dachshund and the face, ears and coloring of a Cattle dog. While she can be shy when meeting new people, she warms up quickly. She loves to cuddle and put her head in her foster mom&#039;s lap and follows her around the house like an adorable shadow. She is such a love bug and truly wants to be close all the time, gazing at her person with those beautiful, expressive eyes. Rosana loves playing with her doggie foster sibling and adorably carries around her favorite pink horseshoe toy all day. She has obviously lived in a home, as she is house-trained, good on the leash and loves to ride in the car. She has a medium energy level, excellent house manners when left home alone and is very treat-motivated. And she already knows how to use a doggie door. Rosie would do well in any number of loving homes, but she&#039;d love to have another dog to play with. Come meet this perfect pup!"

I brought her home and she immediately started sleeping in the bed with me. She was perfect as an apartment dog and quickly became my best friend. She went everywhere with me. She loved walking, but was never a fan of dog parks. She is intimidated by other dogs and although she wants to play, it doesn\u2019t take long for her to show fear aggression. I don\u2019t know her history before my home, but she was a stray in an area that was home to many large \u201caggressive breed\u201d strays. Lola is gluten sensitive, so she eats grain free food and treats. If she gets wheat or gluten in her diet she begins to scratch her belly and undercarriage until she bleeds. Lola has back trouble sometimes. We manage it by making sure she doesn\u2019t go up and down a lot of stairs or jump off of high furniture. On two separate incidents she had to be medicated and rest her back. In April of 2018 my wife and I were blessed with triplet infants. We weren\u2019t expecting so many babies but we figured 3 dogs and 3 babies- what could go wrong? well we quickly saw that once the babies were moving around, Lola and her back issues were not ready for triplets.\nLola would be happiest in a home with no other dogs or small children. She would do well with older children who understand to be gentle. She is a great best friend and companion. She is accustomed to a life where she is the best friend and priority, and she deserves a life where she isn\u2019t afraid all the new little people will stand or fall on her. Lola is still very active and playful and would love to live somewhere that she can be taken for walks. She loves to play with dog toys or play fetch. Lola is a loyal best friend and is very affectionate to her person\n"	"https:\/\/dl5zpyw5k3jeb.cloudfront.net\/photos\/pets\/44504122\/1\/?bust=1555765306"	"https:\/\/dl5zpyw5k3jeb.cloudfront.net\/photos\/pets\/44504122\/1\/?bust=1555765306","https:\/\/dl5zpyw5k3jeb.cloudfront.net\/photos\/pets\/44504122\/2\/?bust=1555765309"	"adoptable"	"House trained","Spay\/Neuter"	null	false	true	null	null	null	false	Central Texas Dachshund Rescue	not-adopted

Eat , sleep play, repeat. That&#039;s my normal mantra. Cooper and his siblings love to play. They play before they will eat in the mornings, have a quick breakfast, and play again. Cooper and his siblings are around 9 weeks old. They are developing personalities of their own. They love to explore, and hide under the furniture from one another. They love to play and wrestle. They have lots of toys but of course they like to all play with the same one. Running and chasing each other around. Watching three pups all trying to hold a tennis ball is quite hilarious. Cooper likes to snuggle in your lap after he&#039;s worn out from playing. And he sleeps through the night like a champ. The pups are too young to go outside potty, they need to complete their puppy vaccines first. We have been working on paper training. Cooper is doing very well, he will even get back into their playpen to go potty on the paper. Of course, he is still a baby . Accidents will happen. Carrots and Golden delicious apple wedges are his favorite treats. They are great for pups to munch , healthy and cold from the fridge can help with teething discomfort. Young puppies like to chew, a carrot is a great alternative. The pups are up to date for age on vaccinations and preventables. They still need to be neutered and micro chipped, which will be done before they leave my care. Cooper is looking for a family to call his own. Is that you?

During the first couple of days, his foster mom thought &quot;something is just not right&quot;. Toby seemed to be very calm for a puppy. He was following Disney and the other dogs around and played but seemed to be hesitant sometimes. Puppies really don&#039;t have brakes, but Toby was never really making the first step and was following everybody or was just by his foster mom&#039;s feet. He did run around being all puppy playful but every once in a while would run into something. \n\nToby&#039;s foster mom voiced her concern to the vet and it seems that Toby is either blind or has some sort of vision disability.\n \nIn order to help him thrive better, Disney and Toby were separated. Toby has a hard time being crated alone, he is confused without another puppy around.

She&#039;s been learning commands like sit, down and shake. She walks really well on leash and only needs a few reminders not to pull. Hope is always appreciative of pets and cuddles, she plays gently and is not mouthy at all. She will &#039;talk&#039; and play growl with her toys and likes to hide her chewies in the couch cushions and then arranges the couch blankets over the hiding spot. She rarely barks, and she&#039;s been very polite when meeting new people. Hope is ok with being crated, but doesn&#039;t really need it as she is fine when home alone. She&#039;s also not an early riser and is happy to sleep in with you. Hope is a just the easiest dog to have around.

Also, can I have more treats?&#039; This soulful and sweet boy is ready to give you all of his snuggles and love and he can&#039;t wait to find his forever home so he can show off all his great skills! Tyson is currently living a foster family and loves playing, wrestling and running with his doggie foster sibling and would love to have a similarly energetic pup to mix it up with. Tyson tires out before his doggie pal, but he stubbornly keeps going and will try to play forever. He&#039;s no long distance runner, but he will chase a tennis ball to the end of the earth! He&#039;s great at playing fetch and will hunt the ball out even after it&#039;s put away. Tyson is an amazing cuddle bug who couldn&#039;t be happier snuggled up next to you, making sure his head is rested close to you or on your leg. He will stare at you with his deep, sweet eyes to ask to snuggle and loves being kissed on his nose. At home Tyson is very gentle and responsive to commands and he knows a lot of them. He knows to &#039;back away&#039; from food and &#039;stop playing&#039; when him and his doggie buddy get too rough. He paws the door or bumps the doorknob to go potty, and knows sit, lay down, &#039;watch me&#039; and &#039;give paw&#039;. He even goes to bed on command (which is the perfect time to listen to his cute little snore!). He isn&#039;t crazy about his crate, but he&#039;ll stay in it quietly while his foster parents are at work. Tyson loves hearing his name called, and looks heartbroken when he is scolded and is quick to stop doing bad things. He is always eager to please and doesn&#039;t want you to be disappointed in him. If all that wasn&#039;t impressive enough, Tyson has a very soft coat and the most adorable freckles all over his nose, chest and belly. He even has an amazing &#039;happy run where his paws clop up and down like a horse while his lips flap up and down with delight! Tyson wants nothing more than to love and be loved by you. He learns SO quickly and will be incredibly loyal to his forever home! Come meet this great pup!"

The owners did not take the time to socialize him, let him out of his small, unsheltered pen, or feed him adequate food for his size.\u00a0Hoss was being cared for by neighbors because they became concerned when he was under weight and sickly. The local police and animal control could not do anything to help unfortunately because it &quot;looked like&quot; he was cared for once the neighbors stepped in. He was in a filthy pen for 3-4 yrs. He was so thin you could see his ribs and hip bones, and his hair was falling out.\u00a0 Eventually, he was rescued from his situation, but he has some behavioral issue from his abuse.\n\nI need to place this dog because I do not know how to train him properly so he can live a happy stress-free life that he so deserves. He is gaining weight and slowly working on bonding with people. I have been walking him daily, and he looks forward to going on his walks and seeing me. Hoss is making great progress with more walks and socializing with my other dogs, but he is not to be trusted around small dogs or off leash. He has no people aggression and is not bothered by children; he just takes some time to like them, but that will improve too with love. \u00a0His aggression issues are much better. I believe the neuter, along with the walks and the love he is getting are contributing to the improvement.

I am up to date on my vaccinations and receive monthly heartworm preventative meds and have never had any issues with that. Other than yearly allergies which seem to occur every April, I am in good health. I just visited my vet last week and got my yearly allergy shot, so I should be good for a while. \n\nTemperament wise I am fairly calm. I tend to get hyper when cooped up too long, but as long as I get my daily walk I am fine. I like to play with other dogs just fine, but I DO NOT like cats at all. I am somewhat nervous around new people, but as long as they are friendly and calm towards me I don\u2019t have any problem. As far as children go, I think I would do much better living in a house with older kids who will play with me.

If you were to just think of a random dog, you would probably think of a dog like Horace. Playful, goofy, affectionate, loyal and always just a tad confused, he is all dog all the time, and his demeanor reminds his foster mom of Dante the dog from Coco. Horace is house-trained, polite in the home and gets along great with other dogs of all shapes and sizes and wrestles with his foster doggie siblings every chance he gets. He prefers to be around people at all times, but can entertain himself with a toy or Kong if needed. He&#039;s super affectionate and likes to snuggle in close, and he will not think twice about climbing into your lap or anyone else&#039;s. He&#039;s a bit of a gangly sort. Some of his parts, like his feet and ears, seem a bit too big for the rest of him. It just makes him extra cute. Horace has a moderately high energy level, he loves fetch and is amazing at it - so much so, that if he can&#039;t get someone to throw the ball for him, he will kick it all over the yard with his big paws so he can chase it! Horace is for the true dog lovers out there, and he&#039;d love an active home where he&#039;ll get plenty of exercise and be included in the family&#039;s adventures. Come meet him!"

He is always thumping his tail when someone comes into view and has been known to make a piggy snorting noise when he is excited. He also has the best bark - putting the accent of the FFFF in WOOOFFFF. Even though he snores like a freight train, you can&#039;t help but smile when you hear him napping. Churchill is house-trained and has free reign of the house when left alone. Due to some mobility issues we&#039;re still trying to get to the bottom of, he hasn&#039;t been out on many walks. And in lieu of zoomies, he does adorable rapid-speed tippy-taps to show how happy he is. He&#039;s also done wonderfully with his foster doggie sibling, a 7 year-old Rottie mix, and he&#039;d love a home with a doggie friend or two.

Just like the goodest boy he shows his love for you And when he shines he really shows you all he can  Oh Rio, Rio wishes for his forever friend! Oh Rio\u2019s family come and let\u2019s go hike the Rio Grande!  Rio has been an absolute doll of an office dog for the last few months with the Animal Protection Officers. He was always excited to have anyone walk into the office and insisted on greeting each and everyone. He never chewed on anything that wasn&#039;t explicitly given to him, and even then he wasn&#039;t much of a chewer. He does love a well stuffed kong or treats though! The only notable time he took something that wasn&#039;t his was when he took a staff member&#039;s zip-up hoodie to his bed to sleep with. He didn&#039;t do anything but snuggle it, and that is doawn right heart-warming and endearing. He loves to walk and could be a great running\/hiking buddy. We hope a public kennel will help him find his furever home or a lovely foster until that certain someone(s) come along.   For further information and inquires please come to the shelter and meet this sweet boy. His Champion is Hilary, she works here and is the owner of previously mention hoodie, so just ask if she is in and she would be more than happy to come help you get to know this chocolate dream boy! You can also reach out via email to: hilary.shurtleff@americanpetsalive.org.   He would do best in a home with no cats, but a doggy friend could be nice!!"

He is a dog that loves his humans dearly and will happily follow and be by them all day long. Part Basenji, Bruce very rarely barks, and his primary modes of communication are to perk up his head and ears when he hears something of interest (which makes him look like a little fawn) or to make a cute whimper sound. On a scale of 1 to 10 for cuteness, sweetness, and elegance, he&#039;s definitely an 11. Bruce&#039;s name includes Baryshnikov because he is known to elegantly prance around, leap, and stand on his legs like a ballet dancer. He loves to chew on empty toilet paper rolls, chase balls and play with other pups his size, and he enjoys going on long walks to explore the neighborhood and nature. He&#039;s sweetheart with kids, cats, and other dogs, although he can be shy with the bigger ones. Bruce still has some puppy in him and is making good progress on his house-training and does pretty well in a crate. Bruce is nice combination of cuddly and playful and would make a wonderful addition to any number of loving homes.

By this time, they had not been socialized or exposed beyond their &quot;sheltered&quot; life.

She is shy by nature and not used to all the activity and stimulus of the big, outside world she has never known.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Briana relies on and seeks comfort in her sister and roommate, Krystal.  Briana is a beautiful girl whose father is a purebred German Shepherd.  She is good with other dogs but has never been around cats or children.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Briana will prefer a quieter type of household without a lot of traffic, and a small circle of friends.  She needs a home with someone experienced with dog behavior who understands, accepts, and honors her limitations.  A patient person with a soft tone and touch, who doesn&#039;t expect a lot out of her, but wants an easy companion to hang out with at home, will be the best match for bringing out all Briana can offer.
